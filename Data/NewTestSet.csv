Subject:RE: AWS / CLIO Backups

Good morning, Deana.

To be honest, we don’t do a lot with AWS, so our teams don’t get much experience with it.

I had used AWS with my previous company and had just become an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner before I had joined Next Digital in 2019. I haven’t used AWS much since then, so I’m behind on the newest features but I expect I’m one of the most experienced/trained people we have for it.

If you’d like us to connect and take a look, please forward this email to support@mnptechnology.ca and ask for it to be assigned to me. I might need 30 minutes to review your AWS configuration and CLIO documentation, and if it isn’t clear then I’d reach out to CLIO technical support and solve it with their assistance.

Have a great day.

Armand,

James and I were wondering if you have an engineer on staff who is familiar with AWS backups. CLIO backups are done through AWS but we are having some challenges getting our account set up properly. We were hoping someone there is already familiar with it and it wouldn’t take many hours for them to help get it backing up properly.

Thanks,

I tried calling you, however Cindy let me know you just stepped out.

Our Creative team sent an email with access to your sound file for your message on hold, which you'll find further down the email thread.

Will you be uploading the file to your phone system or will you have your IT people load it?

Warmest Regards,

1777585,Edmonton Community Foundation,Kathy Hawkesworth,Can't connect to G drive,"Hi.
My computer no longer connects to the G drive with the fix previously installed (there was a problem on site at the office yesterday that I think was fixed in a way that made this remote fix no longer work)

Plus:
Again something has taken possession of the speakers so that I cannot use zoom – it indicates no speaker.
I know the last time this problem was fixed there was something in settings that indicated that Apps could take possession of the speaker – I cannot find that setting to correct it.

With the reboot done earlier this week by MNP this stopped working.

It cripples me to not be able to access documents on the G Drive.  I am going to start saving everything on my desktop so that I don’t lose access.  But currently I have kept my local drive clean.

Emails not showing up on recipients end (group2 to group2)

### Details of Issue
Hi, I recently found out that two emails (from myself) haven't shown up on the recipients (James Simpson's) end. This is obviously quite troublesome as one would hope emails are being delivered to the intended person.  James mentioned that he was trying out some filters/sorting but didn't think that was the issue as the emails didn't ever appear.   Can you please check into this and confirm if there is something prohibiting the delivery? It's not a huge deal for these emails, but I need to be assured that my emails are going out and being received.

Please call if more information is needed.

Thanks,
Amy Wowk

Hi me again!

So our computer issues are not getting better!  We have multiple staff having issues getting on and staying on the RDS, not sure what is going on. But it is getting tough cause we are losing working hours. There was also a day that we couldn’t connect to our printer at Lila Lee as well.

Not sure what you can do, just wanted to let you know, I’ve been off for a few days but I don’t think anyone let you know about our struggles while I was away.

Hi Leta,

We have been having issues with some people printing here at Lila Lee and other computer issues. Connie contacted MNP this afternoon to finally get some answers. She was told that there was an unscheduled emergency maintenance that happened and the IT tech needed to reboot the system. He said this maintenance was unscheduled and therefore only Luiza would know when this happens. When the scheduled maintenance happens we get an email to let us all know. It would be great if someone could even let you know that these unscheduled maintenances are happening so w...",3,2,41,Email Connector,2021-06-10 09:26:19

I was trying to connect Joe to the VPN this morning and he is unable to connect.  The settings will likely have changed with the migration.
Could you please let me know how I should configure the Forticlient VPN?

Subject: Mitek Transfer Center connectivity

Good morning all,

Ema had messaged me that ever since the server changeover a few weeks, she is no longer unable to sign onto the Transfer center to send repairs or sealed drawings.  Anytime we switch servers, we have to re-establish the log-in.  She has tried to use her password, but with no success

Mike Pickett was having a similar issue a couple weeks ago, but he was able to contact general Mitek tech support and is now set up again.  Because Ema is in Cabo, she might have different connectivity than we do.  Aaron is the most familiar with the Azure server compared to the main support staff which are all in Ontario.

I do have admin rights granted to me for the Transfer Center, but was never guided through how to reset passwords, add new users etc, and any past attempts I have made haven't worked.  Aaron, could you co-ordinate with MNP and resolve this??

Thank you,

Good afternoon Chris,

I hope this email finds you well, it’s been a bit since we’ve spoken.

We had Ricoh come in yesterday to do a hands on training session for our new printer that was deployed in December.  Unfortunately, they were unable to show us everything we needed as it appears that the printer is not speaking to our drivers properly.  We need to get everyone on the same page to get this resolved as it is quite an expensive unit that was purchased so we could handle all of our marketing needs in-house.  Our hope is to have Richard and/or Shae join in this meeting as they are both very familiar with our operations and the new equipment that has come into our building in the past few months.

If you could please let me know your availability so I can get a calendar invite sent out, that would be terrific.

Thank you,

Subject: RE: Unicon phone upgrades/extenders

Hi Brett,

Unfortunately, there is no software/firmware upgrade that changes the amount of keys on the phone.
I will do my best to summarize the key options of the current phones.

If your phone is a KX-NT553 you have 2 pages of 12 self-labelling keys (24 button)
If your phone is a KX-NT556 you have 3 pages of 12 self-labelling keys (36 button)
You can add a KX-NT505 DSS Console to either of the above phones for an additional 48 keys
The console’s keys are not on “pages” but are 4 additional rows of 12 buttons. The are labelled with paper strips rather than “self-labeling” with LCD display.
There is a limit to the amount of consoles per system 8 max .

Lastly, Panasonic introduced a phone in the 6XX series that has 4 pages of 12 self-labelling keys (48 button)
This is the KX-NT680 – they did change the orientation of the keys on this phone.
There are two rows of 6 on either side of the large LCD display.
The one challenge with this phone we find is that some of the function keys are labeled with picto icons rather than a word describing the function.

I will need to loop sales into this for the current pricing.

Hi Terry,

Taylor from our office had a conversation with you about running out of room for flex buttons on our phone lines.

In order to have additional ‘pages’ on the phones we would need to upgrade them or buy phone extenders for each phone?  What is the cost of that?  Are there any other options?

See if we can turn them off  and if we can't, get them blocked by CS.  Look under their service tickets to see the details.  Make sure we don't block everything from csu52.org though, as they are a phone customer.  The meails are still coming in to gotel service.

RDS Connection Issues

### Details of Issue
Hi. My RDS sessions freezes and drops A LOT.  I have worked with my home internet provider, and am now incredibly confident it is not a home wifi issue.  We have even installed a series of wifi extenders in the house....full signal everywhere with fibreoptic internet.  This is especially challenging during virtual meetings, where regularly I am freezing constantly.    This is having a significant impact on my work, and is quite concerning as I am facilitating a number of virtual meetings coming up, including a planning session with the Board.

 ConnectWise Automate

### What is the URL or Ticket Number where you are experiencing this problem?
#1773088

### Describe the issue.
- Automate agent gets installed on a WVD host
- Automate treats it as a workstation (Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise for Virtual Desktops x64)
- Either the script/person who installed/reinstalled Automate doesn't know about the EDF ""Force Workstation 24/7 Group Join"" flag, or they've set it but it takes 24 hours to apply.
- Automate shuts the host down with the script ""Workstation - Postpatch - Verify & Shutdown""
- Amin Hirji gets irate calls from people unable to work, and has to manually start the WVD host in Azure.
- Incidents:
(June 1) WVD-SALES-1 shut down on a nightly basis for two weeks until Amin submitted a ticket, but even after Braden informed me of the Extra Data Field flag and I enabled it, the WVD host still shut down once more that night.
(June 4, today) Amin Hirji reported that WVD-ADMIN-1 had shut down last night.
- WVD-ADMIN-1 had Automate installed on June 1 at 9 AM for #1772473
- On June 1 at 5 PM, I had reviewed the ""Workstation 24/7 Group"" EDF flag on every Igloo WVD host, only found it not enabled on WVD-SALES-1.
- After Amin's report that WVD-ADMIN-1 had shut down last night. I checked that EDF flag on WVD-ADMIN-1 and found it was off. Turned it on. 
- I don't know how the flag was turned off, and Automate won't let me set maintenance mode to prevent it from shutting down this evening. Submitted #1774593 for that.
- My confidence in setting that flag has been shaken. I feel we need an onboarding script that detects a WVD host and automatically sets the ""Workstation 24/7 Group"" EDF flag. If we already have one, then something is turning off the flag.",2,2,43,DeskDirector,2021-06-04 09:09:13

Linda Tickner's Surface Pro problem

### Details of Issue
Approx every 15 to 30 seconds, Linda's computer is making a chiming sound.  I can't describe it so I have tried to record it on my phone and have attached it to this ticket.  (sorry it is very quiet on the recording) It happens when she is off the cloud, so I believe it is something on the Surface Pro.  It is very annoying and disruptive when she is on Video calls.  She is in the office today if someone can help her.

Thanks @Christian for the introduction.

Hi @Johnas Christian mentioned we are the IT company and responsible to infrastructure related items. This does include what I understand to be exclusive access to Name Juice where the registrar. We also have should have exclusive access Ilap which hosts the DNS zone files.  We do not host the website or have anything really to do with that. One of the services we provide is being able to update various records if a person on record sends them  to us in Bind format with a schedule of when to make the changes to the Zone Files.

I logged into Name Juice just to be on the safe side and can confirm that we only have DNS records in there, and no website hosting.

I do not know whom the webdev that was working for Belmont is but likely they have their own shared server for their clients. I check the ASN of the IP address and it seem to be hosted at LiquidWeb

Request #14522 ""Lexus of Edmonton / Scala LDN pl..."" was closed and merged into this request. Last comment in request #14522:
Hi Oarrie,
The hand-drawn picture attached with the package shows the general setup in a server room or a local area, whereas the HDMI cable that goes to the TV can be going instead to a powered HDMI splitter or powered HDMI extender.
The current black Seneca box contains 2 channels and should have at least 2 output cables leading out of it. I mentioned previously that the BrightSign players have only one HDMI output. This is why you are receiving 2 BrightSign players, for the 2 channels.
To be more specific, the previous Seneca black box, once removed, should have one available power connection, one available ethernet connection, and 2 output connections. Each BrightSign player can provide only 1 of the 2 output connections. This will mean that you will need another power connection and another ethernet connection to support the two BrightSign LDN players that will be replacing your existing Seneca LDN player.
If you let me know the details of the setup at the dealership, such as how many powered extender boxes between the old Scala LDN box and the TVs, video walls, and other display devices, then I can draw you a more definite diagram.
All the best,
Logan Fan

Logged Time
May 27 2021  5:52AM  (UTC + 05:30) IST - India Standard Time

Issue Description

I’ve got myself into a situation. 

I have a client who has on-prem AD and Exchange. They also use Microsoft 365 app for business. These were not synced when I started. They had existing users created in Azure already because they were using apps. They used the .onmicrosoft username to authenticate. 

I added a domain in the O365 portal and verified. I also added the same domain as an alternative UPN suffix in AD. I changed the UPN on all the applicable users in AD. I then did a sync believing that they would match up. They did not and it created duplicate users. One with the @domain.ca which is synced and the existing O365 account that was already there and licensed. 

Looking back I think if I had changed the primary Username in O365 they would have matched up and merged.  

I have to do an Exchange Hybrid migration and I can see this causing problems.

Some advice would be appreciated.

Subject: Automated email delivery

Hi Kathy,

Here’s the solution to the email issue we’ve been working on… The short answer is MNP will need to add   ip4:72.52.217.70 to their SPF recordat cloudflare.

The long form, if anyone cares, is...

This is your DMARC policy set in your DNS at cloudflare for   aaa.ab.ca domain 

_dmarc.aaa.ab.ca.    282    IN    TXT    ""v=DMARC1; p=reject; pct=100""

So what this says is

p=reject – Tell the receiver to completely deny any unqualified mail for the domain. With this enabled, only mail that is verified as 100% being signed by your domain will even have a chance at the inbox. Any mail that does not pass is denied— not bounced—so there’s no way to catch false positives.

“pct=100”  = Percent – This part tells the receiving server how much of their mail should be subjected to the DMARC policy’s specifications. You can choose any number from 1-100. In this case, if the p= was set to reject, 100% of the mail that fails DMARC would be rejected.

DMARC tells recipient servers how to treat your messages if they do not pass SPF or DKIM authentication.

Following is the SPF record

aaa.ab.ca.        300    IN    TXT    ""v=spf1 a ip4:64.132.221.24/29 ip4:64.34.21.253 ip4:64.34.21.196 ip4:216.220.41.88 ip4:216.220.41.78 ip4:142.59.212.96 include:etechhosting.ca include:servers.mcsv.netinclude:_spf.prod.hydra.sophos.com include:sendgrid.net  -all""

None of this in the SPF record approves host.intrinsicdesign.ca (72.52.217.70) as an approved sender.

We’re still working out some of the other disconnect. More news as I have it!

Susan

Good morning,
Are you able to put together a quote for a replacement notebook for my brother?  He currently has a 13 inch Dell.  I’d love to price out both a Lenovo and Dell.

13 inch size, touch screen not required
Would be nice to have a regular size USB port

12GB RAM

Can you quote a Lenovo and a Dell?

Thank you

### Details of Issue
I'm having a few issues with some emails:
On nblock@barmac.ca - I am not receiving some emails, but they are not in my Sophos Quarantine. I knew about them because bmaclean@barmac.ca was also sent these emails and the nblock@barmac.ca email is on them, but I did not receive them. Nor can I find thme in Sophos
Also, bmaclean@barmac.ca is receiving emails, but every email he is receiving also has nblock@barmac.ca included. I don't seem to be receiving them all (but they might be in Sophos). These two emails were linked before (I was able to access Bart's emails from my Outlook, but this is not necessary. 
Lastly (hoping to solve this myself) - I can't find the Signature option in my Outlook that was just downloaded. Our account manager talked about getting us some signature software....probably a good time to make this change

Subject: Task need to add in checklist - Igloo

Good Morning Paul,

Yesterday I discussed with @Amin Esmaeiliregarding two tasks need to add for MNP Field Technician in their checklist

1. WVD User Profile

 Igloo migrate from RDS to WVD 100%, and earlier RDS user profile was saving on VM level file share, but now we have all the user profiles on FSlogix to Azure File share, so we want to make a proper monitoring checklist so that users do not stop working when the profile is full, and we can make a necessary step before user hit the full capacity.
 We have updated the proper step by step document on how to check the profile size and disk/volume expansion in IT Glue
 IT Glue Document: Viewing FSLogix Users’ Profile Sizehttps://nextdigital.itglue.com/4711756/documents/folder/2735366/?preview=7550098
 IT Glue Document: Expanding FSLogix Profilehttps://nextdigital.itglue.com/4711756/documents/folder/2735366/?preview=7515854
 If they get used to the task, it should not take more than 5-10 minute

1. Datto Backup Solution for M365

 we have deployed the Datto backup solution for M365, and@Amin Esmaeili is working with Datto to gain access to MNP
 your tech can log in and verify the backup are running properly
 we have updated the step by step for restoring the data IT glue
 IT Glue Document: Datto M365 Backup  https://nextdigital.itglue.com/4711756/documents/folder/2735402/
 If they get used to the task, it should not take more than 5-10 minute

Maybe the MNP team needs some update on the document according to their experience; let Fiedlis know, and he will make a change.

1772416,Liberty Security Systems,Brittany Carter,Re: Salvation Army Grace Manor,"Hello Dave, 

I received the following email from Frank this morning. 

""Can you please call Dave to look at the phone system problem on site?

I've spent my whole weekend receiving calls from Martin Davis because the messaging to cordless phones of the Nursecall system has not been working properly since Saturday morning and the transfer of calls from the outside calls are not working. The whole system was working properly when I left the site on Friday night and Martin was happy. Saturday morning I got a call saying that the messaging is not working. I checked and restarted the Eiris server and it worked. Before noon, I got a call saying it was not working again. I did not find any problem with the programming so I did restart the Eiris server and DMLS programs and the Nursecall system started to work again. He called again in the evening, this time I've decided to uninstall and installI the Eiris program, restarted the DMLS, restarted all the DAP's and restarted the PBX. I think I got the Nursecall part fixed after a number of resets of the devices and programs, rebooting the pbx and re-installing the Eiris. 

For the call transfer problem, I tried to find missing programming yesterday and today. I have checked the PBX programming and found some programs that were not transferred after the upgrade but those did not fix the call transfer issue. I had the call transfer working 2x by rebooting the PBX but it just quit again. When I dial the main line, I hear an auto-attendant asking to ""press 7 for the Nurse"" or ""0 for reception"". None of those digits will connect and will say ""your call cannot go through"". When I call in and dial directly the Nurse's extensions (2501 & 2502) the call is connecting, also when I dial the reception extension 2015 it is connecting.""

Hoping this can be prioritized this morning. 

Thank you!

Greetings Luiza,
I hope you are well!
We are planning steps for our transition back to 13047 102 St in mid-June (Wednesday June 16th), and so, we will be needing to transfer services (again!).

### Details of Issue
Hi there, we are having some difficulties with one of our 3rd party vendors, Pathway, and they have asked that we verify with you the following: 
""could you please check in with your IT if the following IPs were added to your SPF records already?
ip4:167.89.105.212
ip4:192.254.119.187
Additionally, if they have DKIM and DMARC set up to allow Pathway?""

Secondary to this, our daily Pathway Sync which should be scheduled as a nightly utility via Power Tools appears to have been suspended. I think this might be a result of some of the server issues we were having a few weeks ago. If we could have that scheduled sync reinstated, that would be very helpful too. Thank you!

Thanks, Shawn.  Brian will drop it off.  It is running now, but for how long?  I can’t seem get signed into Microsoft Office.  Since Microsoft Office was installed, I have very little memory space available on the surface pro.

The current screen size is 10” and it is a touch screen. I could go up in screen size.  I don’t need top of the line, but I need to be able to work on files without running into space issues.

Thanks Shawn. I am using Brian's old SurfacePro so I think it is older. I will have Brian drop it by your offices. It won't power up. It has happened a few times in the last couple of months.

If it has outlived its lifespan, I don't know what I should look at for a replacement.

Good Morning,

I might be the worst sales person in the world with his recommendation but I am pretty sure that Surface is only about a 2.5 years old and it should still be delivering a decent end user computer experience for Darlene. So I have to recommend that we have a look at it and try to maybe give it a bit of a “tune-up” before going down the replacement path.

Thoughts?

Yes, I have the laptops labelled in accordance to their performance, with the ones labelled #1 and #2 being the top performing machines from the bunch.

Helen knows where the laptops are stored, with that said; we can give the laptop labelled with a #1 sticky note to Rachel.

The requested programs listed below will need to be setup.

Hi Ali and Amin,

Apologies for including you both on this, but I wasn't sure which of you would be best to contact! We will have a new employee starting on March 31st named Rachel Anand, and she'll need a laptop that has MS Office, FortiClient, server access, and all of those fun things!

Ali I believe you checked over the spare laptops that are at the office recently, is there one that is in good enough shape to be assigned to a new employee? And is there anything that either of you need to do on your end before we hand it over to her?

Thanks so much for your help!

Lesley

Hello Sales,

I need to do some research into some laptops that we could possibly use as an alternative choice to the Surface Pro.  I was thinking about Surface Laptops, if they would be compatible with our existing Surface Pro docking stations, and touch screen would be nice.

I like Lenovo laptops but their docking stations are big (at least they used to be) and it seems like they all use different docks.

Another alternative might be something that uses a universal dock.

I am trying to replace more units with the same funding – not easy, I know.  I would appreciate any suggestions you could give us.

Thanks,
Joey

Good Afternoon,
We have been alerted by a few of our brokers that they have been contacted by cyber criminals fraudulently misrepresenting Premier to change/update their current payment method from an email originating from the domain of prenniergroup.com, and wish to make your teams aware of this and advise them to be vigilant in relation to any attempted spoofing from this domain.“Prenniergroup.com” is not a legitimate Premier domain and any communications you receive from it will in all likelihood be a malicious attempt to conduct fraud or breach your network.
1. Please note that our email addresses are @premiergroup.ca but thephishing perpetrator has used @prenniergroup.com.
2. Further we confirm that our organizationhas not made any requests for there to be changes/updates to your current payment methods with Premier.

In light of these events, although these did not originate from Premier, in order to try to further protect all of our valued partners we have changed the targeted email addresses so please do not use the one in your auto contacts.
If your IT team or IT Service Provider is able to, we would recommend that 'prenniergroup.com' is immediately added to a domain blacklist so any traffic from it is blocked at the perimeter and will never reach any of your users.Please make sure our correct corporate domain isn’t blocked (premiergroup.ca).
We have also informed both the RCMP and The Vancouver PD of this activity but have been advised that as this activity did not originate from Premier, there is nothing further that we can do.
We would ask that you please remind all your teams that if they are uncertain of an email requesting to update/change payment methods from Premier they should immediately reach out to our Controller, located in Vancouver - Angel Moy.

Can someone please check and re-boot our Server 2K8? I have a feeling it has frozen up. One of our Accounting team has lost connection to an HP printer scanner that she uses daily.

The text is frozen in place and the diplay is dimmed. If this could be done ASAP, i would appreciate it. Thanks!

Dear Nicole,

[image]

[image]
Please be aware of an important upcoming change in regards to phone support with Veeam®.

[image]

[image]
Starting June 7, Veeam will require an existing case number in order for you to receive phone support. You can create a new case at https://my.veeam.com.

[image]

[image]
This change is based on customer feedback and designed to help Veeam consistently ensure a high quality of service, as well as to improve response times to support tickets and resolution. The Case Portal has been improved to streamline incident reporting, log upload, as well as other optimizations we believe will greatly improve your case experience.

[image]

[image]
Because you will need to have an active technical case or open a new case on my.veeam.comin order to utilize phone support, this may be a good time to familiarize yourself with The Case Portal at https://my.veeam.com. If you experience any issues logging in, https://www.veeam.com/kb4160 has been created to assist you with this issue.

[image]

[image]
Our guide at https://www.veeam.com/kb1771provides instructions for using The Case Portal. Please also ensure you've set the required Case Administrators for your Licenses; you can review the Case Administrator process here: https://www.veeam.com/kb2211.

[image]

[image]
At your earliest convenience, take the time to review the following articles and ensure you and your organization (and all organizations you are responsible for) are aligned with Veeam's case administration processes:

[image]

 Case Administrators Guide
 How to Open a Licensing Case - For if you don't know your current Primary License Administrator (who can setup Case Administrators) or are unsure of your current support ID.
 A guide for Partners to setup the ability to open cases on behalf of their customers

[image]

[image]
Starting from June 7, Technical Customer Support will not open cases manually on the phone. If you need phone support on a technical or licensing case, you are required to open a case on Veeam's Customer Portal before calling Veeam Customer Support after June 7.

[image]

[image]
If you need assistance with this process or any other issue, please open a ticket on https://my.veeam.com. This email box is not monitored for replies.

For our Edson phone number (780-723-5955)……I am not sure what Gilles did here so would like you to take a look when you have a chance.

What we want is for when someone calls the Edson phone number that it simultaneously rings to Frank Araneda’s cell number.  (780-728-5585)

This way if he is in the office he can choose to pick up the Handset or his cellphone.   As well when he is on the road, he is still getting the office phone calls (and hopefully voicemails)

After speaking with Frank this morning, it seems that the office phone rings once and then automatically goes to his cell phone.  Which is not what we want.

Please let me know what you find…..as I was unable to figure out what has been done here.

Thanks

Symptom

Duplicate Users in AAD

Description

I’ve got myself into a situation. 

I have a client who has on-prem AD and Exchange. They also use Microsoft 365 app for business. These were not synced when I started. They had existing users created in Azure already because they were using apps. They used the .onmicrosoft username to authenticate. 

I added a domain in the O365 portal and verified. I also added the same domain as an alternative UPN suffix in AD. I changed the UPN on all the applicable users in AD. I then did a sync believing that they would match up. They did not and it created duplicate users. One with the @domain.ca which is synced and the existing O365 account that was already there and licensed. 

Looking back I think if I had changed the primary Username in O365 they would have matched up and merged.  

I have to do an Exchange Hybrid migration and I can see this causing problems.

Some advice would be appreciated.

Hi Luiza, 

To confirm that your facility's download and upload speeds meet our minimum recommendations, a WiFi Audit is required. This process requires an employee to test multiple locations throughout the facility using a laptop and cellphone. We will be connected remotely to perform the speed test and signal strength tests. 

Can you please let us know when you or someone would be available for a 1-hour block of time to conduct this WiFi Audit? Our team can assist Monday-Friday between 8 AM PST and 3 PM PST. 

Best regards,

Hi Team,

Eugene Ng and Chris Law have an opportunity with the City of Chilliwack.

They would like us to put a quote together for 450 Sophos XDR licenses.  They would also like to have us manage the product so I am not sure what that looks like from a monthly cost standpoint, but I will figure that out.

We need to register the deal as soon as possible and then get a quote together.

If you have any questions about details, please reach out to Chris or Eugene.

1770138,Richmond Equity Management Ltd,Scott Yester,Scott Yester - Wifi Slower than Similar Computer and Speakers Not Working,"Hi there,

My work laptop is an HP ProBook 440 G7

[image]

And my personal laptop is an HP EliteBook 840 G5.

I have had wifi issues with my work laptop pretty routinely, especially when it comes to video calls on Teams.

I have Shaw BlueCurve set up in my house with pods.  My account is for up to 600 Mbps.  I’m not sure how familiar you are with these pods, but apparently it creates a network “mesh” and automatically connects you to the port with the best signal.  My work laptop has difficulty connecting to the pod near my home office and instead often connects to the Gateway on the main floor whereas my personal laptop seems to remain connected to the upstairs pod quite well.  That’s issue number 1.  But even still, my signal quality appears to be good but my speed is horrendous.  For instance, my work laptop is connected to the Gateway on the main floor right now and this is what the control panel is showing:

[image]

But when I run a speed test on speedtest.net, this is all I’m getting (and this is actually not a horrible result):

[image]

In fact, I took this screenshot last week when my signal appeared to be fine but Outlook for instance couldn’t even connect:

[image]

I have been able to run just the Windows diagnostics before and got this message:

[image]

Furthermore, when I take both laptops and my iPhone close to the Gateway, I get much different speeds.  My work laptop might get in the 70 Mbps download range, while my personal laptop gets >150 Mbps and my iPhone gets >400 Mbps.  That’s issue number 2.

Issue number 3 is that my built in speakers are very low and crackly on my work laptop to the point that they are non-functional.  This makes headphones and mic a requirement for video calls.

I did order an extra 8 GB of RAM from MNP and had our field technician (Mike Farhat) walk me through the installation.  I’m not sure if that’s when these problems started, but that is the only physical thing I have done to this computer.

I know wifi issues are pretty nebulous, but it is beginning to seriously impede my ability to work from home.  Do you have any ideas on how to check what is going on with my work laptop?  I find it hard to believe that its wifi connection should be so much worse than my comparable personal computer.  I reset my network and restarted my work laptop but have had no success.

Thanks,

I think bare minimum is to fill the identify the manager and it should start building stuff from there.
Depending the app .. there may be additional steps in turning the view one…. But it wont do any good if this detail isn’t filled in for each account.  It would require touching each user in AD.
For some users that are currently cloud only, I imagine we have to update this in o365, as the AD objects associated with those accounts are for Antispam only and don’t participate in the AD sync.

I'm hoping one of you can head over to Points West Heritage House again. There is a suite with no dial tone.

Points West Living Heritage House
Address: 4570 Maple Street Vegreville, AB T9C1X2
Scope: ""Residents phone line in suite 2 isn't working. Arlen went to site and confirmed there is no dial tone but there is at the subpanel room.  He also noticed that even when he gets a dial tone, he cannot dial out of the building or get an outside line, so the programming on the PBX might have to be looked at to allow an outside call.""

Frank remoted in today and found the following. ""I tested both lines for room 2 and room 3 since they were swapped in sequence in the bix block. I called my cellphone using both the lines and it went through. This test I did is to confirm the caller ID of the rooms. The only problem is the broken connection from the sub-room to the resident room. An on site service is needed to get into the crawl space to trace the wire. ""

Please let me know if this is something you're able to do asap for us. 

Thank you!

So after we changed or fixed the internet when Amy and Blair were here we
now have been locked out and it says our data has been used up. This means
we cannot use any of our computers for payroll. 
I am not sure what was done here so if someone could give me a call that
would be great and let me know what was done and if we can get a different
plan that would be great. Thanks.

Morning Donalee,

Ryan Mehaney's email or the server may have been compromised over the weekend as people were receiving emails from him with a zip folder attached. He then received a bunch of calls from people that received this email and even individuals that are not on his contact list.

Thanks and just thought I'd let you know.

There has been an issue with this computer for a while…..the computer says it’s on but the monitor won’t get the feed from the computer – the monitor is physically on but won’t load from the computer.  We power off the computer for a while, switch off the monitor and eventually it comes back on – but it takes a while and lots of alternating powering down and back on.  I believe we need a new monitor.

Thank you,

CSD Computers automatically turned off

### Details of Issue
For some reasons my computer, Amanda's and Sharon's computers at the office were turned off automatically. While we can access RDS from home, we still need to access our office computers remotely through RDS to do some accounting functions. 

I came to the office to turn these computers on, so it is not an issue anymore. 

Do you know why these three computers at the office were turned off? I don't know if this was related to the computer updates or  a power issue at that end of the office.

1768097,Next Digital Inc.,Jerry Wilkinson,Jerry Wilkinson - ND - SSL/TLS Medium Strength Cipher Suites Supported,"### Summary of Issue
ND - SSL/TLS Medium Strength Cipher Suites Supported

### Details of Issue
192.168.84.2 (TCP/3389) NDEDM-TESTHOST-01 Server Core –  
▪ 192.168.84.10 (TCP/3389) ndedm-cwpmrds-01 VM on testhost
▪ 192.168.84.11 (TCP/1433) ndedm-cwpmdb-01 VM on testhost

Description:
The above identified hosts support the use of TLS ciphers that offer weak or medium strength encryption.
All TLS ciphers with key lengths of less than 64 bits are considered to be of weak strength and TLS ciphers
with a key length between 64 bits and 112 bits are considered to be of medium strength, or those that
use the 3DES encryption suite.




Recommended Solution:
MNP recommends that SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 be disabled on all hosts and for TLSv1.2 and
TLSv1.3 be used in their place with the following parameters:
▪ Cipher suites (TLS 1.3): TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
▪ Cipher suites (TLS 1.2): ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 ECDHE-ECDSACHACHA20-POLY1305 ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305 DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 DHERSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
▪ Protocols: TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3
▪ TLS curves: X25519, prime256v1, secp384r1
▪ Certificate type: ECDSA (P-256) (recommended), or RSA (2048 bits)
▪ DH parameter size: 2048 (ffdhe2048, RFC 7919)
▪ HSTS: max-age=63072000 (two years)
▪ Maximum certificate lifespan: 90 days (recommended) to 366 days
▪ Certificate Signature : SHA-384 or SHA-512
▪ Cipher preference: client chooses

I am emailing from Baymag out in Exshaw.
I Updated my computer I believe last Tuesday and had no issues with the update itself. When I attempted to print after the update however this action forces my computer to crash.
I spoke with others here at site and a solution was offered by MNP. The solution worked for two of our affected computers. I took the file from the USB that I was given by others in the office to attempt to run the update file on my station and it requires system administrator privileges to run. I had others from our office attempt to log in with their plant level administrative rights and that was not good enough to satisfy the requirements. I cannot send the file back to you via email as it is too large. I do however have it on my computer.

The activity log alert WestUS2-Alert was triggered                                by a service issue                for the Azure subscription IBSG - EA.

COMMUNICATION:              
Summary
Between 21:00 UTC on 13 May 2021 and 05:18 UTC on 14 May 2021, a subset of our customers may have experienced intermittent errors when performing Windows Virtual Desktop management operations via our portal or other management interfaces.
Root Cause and Mitigation
Root cause: We have determined that when Windows Virtual Desktop service deployment which began on 13 May hit the West US2 region, a code change increased the resource usage resulting in issues with servicing resource management requests. The failure rate increased gradually until it became noticeable for Portal operations that involved a large number of backend requests, like displaying the Session Host status list.
Mitigation: The issue was mitigated by taking the faulty role out of rotation, then rolling back the deployment.
Next Steps
We apologize for the impact to affected customers. We are continuously taking steps to improve the Microsoft Azure Platform and our processes to help ensure such incidents do not occur in the future. In this case, this includes (but is not limited to):
 Improve detection and alerting granularity for failures in the Resource Manager path
 Improve design of synchronization in database access operations.

Provide Feedback: Please help us improve the Azure customer communications experience by taking our survey: https://aka.ms/AzurePIRSurvey

### Other Details
As discussed with Spencer yesterday we need to get CMEC setup in CWM as a T4G client to be able to start working some tickets for this client.  We'll be getting a sample of this shortly, but might be the same system as is currently used for Ontario Geonomics, still TBD. These tickets would only be available to Min Kaur Sohal and we're looking to get that going by mid next week ideally. T4G will email us the tickets they need us to start taking care of.  CMEC will be part of the full T4G migration next month, so this is just an interim solution to provide temporary relief to their team prior to the bigger integration/migration occuring in June. No tool deployment or any the other usual onboarding steps apply at this time, we just need a place to dump some tickets and have Min put some time against them please.",1,1,43,DeskDirector,2021-05-20 16:46:21

1767614,MHK Insurance,Dora Jones,RE: Ticket #1380422/RE: Ticket #1357234/Dora Jones - Email Not Received CLOSED NO RESPONSE CLOSED NO,"Hi there,

I finally heard back from peace hills and they have advised I should be receiving their bulletins.  I did advise them of your response below;

I spoke with our Central Services and it appears that if phgic.com is sending emails through SendGrid, they're missing a crucial part of their SPF domain record to allow SendGrid to send email on their behalf. I've been told the spam-filter doesn't always record what it rejects and there's no record of a bulletin being sent, but it will reject an email sending from an unapproved address if it is missing from the SPF record.
We have actually had this complaint from another one of our clients asking about these bulletins not being received and this is the same issue we told them.
Are you able to relay the following information to a contact at Peace Hills to add include:sendgrid.net to their SPF record for their phgic.com domain? The following link should give them the appropriate information: here. They will need to provide it to their IT department that manages their domain

This is the response I received from them;

“The bulletins would come from either:
helpwebsite@phgic.com
help@phgic.com
via sendgrid.net
[image]
I understand the frustration as this problem persists, but if they have not tried the ‘via’ sendgrid.net, perhaps that might help.”

I don’t know what they mean about us trying the via sendgred.net?  Thanks Dora

I've just finished helping Raelene set up her new computer and we had transfered close to 80GB of files from her old computer. I don't see any backups and she's not aware of any so they probably don't have a backups.

Could we look into options for getting their computers that are working from home backed up or possibly cloud storage? I believe we would be recommending O365 so maybe that could be an optionfor having them store company files in the cloud?

I am working from home and had connected to our servers via VPN. I was in my Z network drive (rgraham (\ACSA-T-5738\Users) looking for an old file and noticed a ton of useless stuff I had put there a while ago so decided to do some spring cleaning. There was a folder labeled 'Desktop' on that drive that I had selected without noticing. After I hit Delete I got a 'file in use' message for the most current version of something I had open on my computer. I hit cancel but it was too late, all the files on my local desktop are gone apart from two I had open.
I’ve used Microsoft File Recovery to recover everything on C:Users/rgraham and have recovered some, but not all of my files. Is there another way to get these files back?

1766994,Group2 Architecture Interior Design Ltd.,JON GULAYETS,JON GULAYETS - IP-IT Newforma Upgrade Issues,"Good morning all – We have been having issues with the Procore Connector since the upgrade took place for Newforma Project Centre 12.4.5 (.18944) a little over a week ago.   I have cc’d all those involved hoping we can get resolution as promptly as possible – also hoping Kelly U. at Newforma gets this email as well.

Issue: RFI and submittals seem to be coming over from Procore no problem. However when responding to submittals or RFIs, there’s about a 50% chance that the response won’t get logged back to Procore.

This issue has significant impact on our workflows, hopefully it can be promptly rectified – Thanks!

Our Edmonton office had a power outage Tuesday night and the phones all have the wrong times now. They tried unplugging them and plugging them back in to see if they would reset but no luck.

Our phones in Fort McMurray all have the correct time.

Are you able to reset the time service as per Dave’s email below?

Thanks,

Hi Deana,

Have your IT check rule 42 in the DHCP server to find out what is the time  server. Once they know that have them Log onto that server and restart the time service.

There was a power outage in Edmonton Monday night and when the staff came in yesterday the phones have the wrong date and time. They have unplugged and plugged in the phones but they are still wrong.

Can you give me some suggestions to fix?

Hi Jorge,

I would like to schedule Ali for two site visit at Airdrie Bayside Dental & Orthodontics, one on May/26/21 @ 9 AM MT and the other on Jun/02/21 @ 12 PM MT. Details below.

May/26/21: I’ve shipped the office a new server, I need the power cord connected on the new server along with 2 network cables then turn it on (cable and power cord is in the packaging). Once it’s turned on, call me at 604-910-6147 so I can confirm new server is online and start initial data transfer. Sherri would also like the new Ubiquiti AP mounted in waiting area per last visit.

Jun/07/21: I’ll be working on configuring new server in the morning and need Ali on-site in afternoon to unhook old server and put the new server in permanent location w/ UPS connected. Once completed, need to go around workstation with Sherri to confirm everything is working OK. Ali will call me at 604-910-6147 when he’s on-site so I can provide him list of remaining items.

I decided to order a new laptop.

Other than our issue with huge lag (unfortunately not fixed by last week’s heroic attempts by Faizel) I loved my laptop (Dell 7370). As you may recall I am partial to Dell.
They have a “deal” (they rotate deals constantly) on the below. I like the specs. Please verify the below would integrate with our network, ability to log-in from home, etc.

Would you recommend any different configuration (specs can be altered although have to wait for new “deal”) or otherwise (ie Lenovo equivalent)?

Hi Cheryl,

I’ve forwarded your message to Flavio to ask about the status of the mailbox & delegate cleanup, and the distribution list renaming.

The shared mailbox called “Edmonton Service” edmservice@calmont.cais being copied to the distribution list “>>EdmService Distro” EdmServiceDistro@calmont.ca

So that team can either receive their own copy of messages sent to edmservice@ or check the separate shared mailbox and see which messages have already been read, replied, sorted. Most of that team are both members of the distribution list and delegates on the shared mailbox.

The distribution list “CLLE Service” clleservice@calmont.cahas fewer members than the “>> EdmService Distro” list.
Also, the CLLE Service list is set to not allow emails from outside senders.

1765851,Northland Volkswagen,Deb Brochner,Northland VW - issues with call flow,"Hi Dave, 
So last month, our phones stopped letting people call in and the reception could not answer.  It acted as though they were on Meeting Mode, but it was not.  So the IT help at auto canada put them on Answer Automatically, because sometime it was saying we are closed.  
 
The biggest issue we are having is that sometimes it gets in an auto attendant loop and it says we are closed when we are open.  I believe this may happen  if reception puts it in different modes.  I think with the permanent auto attendant and if they select in a meeting mode, that might happen.  But Maybe you could double check our hours open to make sure that it works on all Modes.
 
We really just want the phones to work like they did before.  On normal mode they ring into reception.  And if they leave their desk, they put them on Meeting Mode, so the auto attendant picks it up and directs the call.  (without telling them we are closed)

Hi Becky
I have taken over for Lori Deluca as the Veeam Account Manager for your organization- CFP Industries Inc
It is great to virtually meet you and keep me in mind as your main resource.
I would like to discuss how we’re helping our customers in the AB region back up and granularly restore their 0365 data, now including Teams.
Microsoft has a “shared responsibility model”, meaning you are responsible for your data. We provide our customers better recovery, better security and long-term retention options to help them protect their data in the event of:
 Accidental Deletion
 Ransomware Attack
 Poor policy configuration leading to data loss
 Internal and External Threats

Do you have 15 minutes to discuss next week?
PS if you are not the right person internally, please push me in the right direction.

Good morning,
I have been working in the Phase 2 area since 7am this morning.  Twice during this time the internet has dropped off completely: the phones restart, the wifi turns off, and hardline internet access to the desktop computers is lost.  Previously Richard Ignecz had been investigating a similar issue with the FortiNet switches.  Is someone able to look at the logs to see how often these outages are happening and work on a solution to stop them from occuring?

You are welcome to contact them to see if they still want to get RDS set up on their personal computers.  I have not heard back from them.

1763911,Hayward Gordon,Jason Gibbs,Missing internal emails - Syspro workflow ,"Hi All,

We have been working with Syspro on an automation routine that let us route new orders to Hayward Gordon or Scott Mixers for manufacturing.

The process works as follows:
1. New order is created for Sharpe Mixers
2. Emailis generated by Syspro system to alert users a new order has been created
3. The user clicks the link in the email and selects Scott Turbon or Hayward Gordon as the manufacturer
4. Email confirmation is sent indicating new purchase order created in Sharpe
5. Email confirmation is sent indicating new order created in Scott Turbon or Hayward Gordon
6. STM or HG manufacture the unit and invoice Sharpe
7. Email confirmation is sent indicating the order in Sharpe has been updated
8. Email confirmation is sent indicating the purchase order in Sharpe has been updated
9. Sharpe Mixers invoices the customer

The email created in step 2 iscritical. Without this email, we cannot select the manufacturing plant and the whole process fails. We cannot regenerate this email. The other emails are important but do not break the workflow.

During testing, we have discovered random (but frequent) emails are not being delivered. Sometimes it’s the email from step 4, sometimes step 5 and sometimesstep 2.

Last night I ran two tests to reproduce the issue. The first test ran perfectly. All five emails were generated and received to my inbox. On the second test, the email for step 8 was not received. If there is any pattern, it seems that the first test of the day usually has no problems. Subsequent tests run on the same day always seem to have a problem. Also, the issue might be that emails from step 4 and 5 are generated nearly simultaneously as are the emails from step 7 and 8.

Here is a summary of the email generating steps from last night with the times received. Can you find out what happened to the email from 6:19PM? I’m also attaching a sample of what the email should look like from test 1 generated at 5:47PM. The email comes from orderentry@haywardgordon.com

This request bounced around our process and a portion of it is a sales quote.
SR ticket - #1396793

The client is looking for a time & materials quote for pulling an analog phone line to a MFP at their ""Village Commons"" location.

The MFP should have two ethernet wall jacks behind it that are pulled from the patch panel in the network room. The analog line can use one of the ethernet lines.

This quote will need to be for labour + materials to pull the analog line for a new fax phone line. SR #1396793 will be for engaging Telus and activating the fax line.",1,1,36,DeskDirector,2021-05-12 16:34:48

Sorry for the wait on this, our apologies. We are pretty sure we can get this resolved and we are looking into this for you and we will get back to you within the next 24 hours.
We are looking into the possibility of replacing the keyboard but first we want to check on the warranty status of this particular tag #. Unfortunately we will have to asses the keyboard on the laptop to see what is wrong with and go from there.

1763342,Next Digital Inc.,Flavio Soares,Flavio Soares - Wipe RDS profile - Having Outlook issues,"### Summary of Issue
Flavio - Format laptop

### Details of Issue
As discussed and presented, I am having weird issues related to my MS 365. Thomas and I agreed that a complete reinstallation of my laptop would alleviate the problems.
So, please format my computer and let me know when it is ready.

I don’t use any special software, and I have also performed the backup of my files.

Please also coordinate to have my RDS profile wiped out since the service desk also had to recreate MS profiles to ensure I have a new clean start.

If you were to need more context, please review the items below:

1.	Uncertain delivery of e-mails - From time to time, a different group of external people, primarily clients, complain that they are not receiving my e-mails. Curiously, internal people copied on the same messages receive it.
Some examples are NRCB, Calmont, MHK and Landrex. Chris Ippolito, Shawn Kubiski, FSTs and Shawn Parks confirmed that they’d received e-mails that the clients report they’ve not.

2.	Calendar and Meetings - Microsoft Findtime and calendar availability internal people complain that sometimes I double book them and cannot join meetings with clients. The last time it happened, Jerry was the one that, for me, was showing as available, but indeed he was busy and scheduled to attend to another duty.

On the other hand, concerning finding time, that’s the other way-round, clients can access and pick up an option (like MHK, R3 Demo, WBS, E4C), but our team tells me that they cannot open it and pick an option. The last time it happened, Kolyn could not open the Findtime request, but the client could do it.

3.	Sent Items not showing on sent items or outbox – In the light of this unusual behaviour,  some e-mails I sent do not show on my sent items either outbox, but the recipient receives it. The last time I realized something like that happened was between Shaw Telecommunications and Shawn Parks, where I was unsure if I sent the e-mail or not, my sent items did not have the e-mail, but Parks (and Shaw) had it there in his inbox the e-mail I sent hours ago. I was 100% sure that the e-mail was not deleted accidentally, and James Anderson also reviewed it for me.

Another curious situation is that “sent” e-mails go straight from the outbox to draft. Suddenly I realize that dozens of e-mails sent never reach the recipient.

4.	“Deferred delivery of e-mails” – Nicole from MHK and Ben from NRCB told me e-mails I sent there days ago were not on their inboxes, and then suddenly they had those e-mail with the timestamp from the day I sent. I am not sure if it is frequent or not or a human error, but those two clients declared that the e-mails were not there before.
Inbox items being redelivered and toggling from read to unread – For this issue was one of the most painful ones since it directly impacted my productivity.

Good afternoon Lukas,

To confirm from your last email, you want Richard and Terry to start setting up the work stations and the phones on Tuesday April 13th. Does an 8am start work for you?

I have forwarded the PrscrnF.pdf to the guys and asked that they fill them out and have them ready for you when they arrive.

We should not need access into the MRI room as long as we can setup the work station and phone at one of the other available spots. I was thinking that we could use either location 11 or 12 on the map attached.

Regards,

Dave Beharrell

While performing the Remote Site Visit today for Raywalt Construction, I discovered Raywalt's Online Stealth Backups have stopped since April 25th of this year, due to the Account being over Quota.

Raywalt does not have Veeam Backups, I recommend the SAM offer Raywalt Veeam as a long term and affordable solution, rather than continue their relationship with Stealth backups.

Clean up AlignOrtho old configs

### Details of Issue
It seems IT Glue has a few records of old devices that have been decommissioned but the documentation does not show this. We had to fumble around today figuring out how to access an AP only to find out it had already been decommissioned and access was through Unifi. We did find the Unifi documentation, but it would be nice to have the old configurations removed, new ones added and have it linked together like we normally do - makes it easy to find things!

Subject: Schedule lock out

Hello!

Over the past couple mornings I’m sure some of you have seen that I apparently have left the schedule open on my computer which locks everyone else out. This is apparently an RDS issue as I just tried to open the schedule myself and it locked me out because….I already had it open?! Anyways if this is an issue in the mornings I sincerely apologize and I’ll try to get to the bottom of this!

1762583,SITE Resource Group,Trina Fitzgerald,Trina Fitzgerald - Heavy Job Timecard Problems,"Good day,
There appears to be an issue with Heavy job shifting employees names and hours from one page to another. Take note of the screen shot below - Michael Burchill is a foreman, on May 10 he entered his hours under his name as the foreman. However, this morning when I was processing the time card his name and  hours shifted to the next page under foreman Lucian Lupescu and his hours were shifted to cells without a cost code which is strange as when I try to enter hours without a valid cost code it returns an error

Dan Boire had a similar problem in the past see prior Ticket Number 1345772.

Hey Ade,
Yes, we are trying to move the scanning that Silke does to her local PC. Currently the scanner works with a laptop that sits by the scanner. All it needs to do is scan to the software and then save to a certain file location. AJ loaded the software and I entered the licensing information which all seemed to work but Silke says it is “transferring” the information and not scanning it. Can you please check in with Silke and see if you can help her get this fixed.

Thanks!

1761056,Soderquist Appraisals Ltd.,Shyllo Kofoed,Lag / unresponsive laptop,"Hello,

My laptop, after booting, is tremendously laggy / unresponsive for the first 10 to 20 minutes once it starts. It is now so laggy I turn it on and do not begin working on it for at least 10 minutes (usually longer).

Using task manager I can see the CPU usage is above 80% for this period, altering from 65% to 95% with numerous processes altering in the top few spaces using 20% to 60% of CPU each. Examples of processes at top spots are:

 Windows Modules Installer Worker
 System
 Sophos Endpoint Defense Software
 Sophos File scanner
 SRE
 Performs Virus Scanning and Disinfection Functions
 WMI Provider Host
 Microsoft Windows Search Filter Host
 Microsoft Windows Search Protocol Host
 Microsoft Search Indexer
 Service Host:Local System
 …

After 15 mins or so, CPU use will fall below 30% and become less laggy but still spikes at time then slowing things down.

Please provide direction how the PC can be available for use quicker.

Thank you,

Shyllo

Hi Matt and Amin,

Please ensure that Laurie Elliot’s contact information is changed to 403-333-3141 in your system and in Active Directory on our network.  As you can see from her email below your helpdesk is unable to understand that she is not taking calls at 403-587-3381 any longer.  I can understand this happening once or twice, but not this many times.  Also while you are in there, please read through that ticket so that you can get a sense of the frustration this user has experienced.

I have had numerous complaints today about not getting calls back on tickets at all.  Is there a problem?

Thanks,
Joey

Subject: RE: Job Folder Size

I would not recommend to delete the entire AutoSave folder, this is our recovery if a job has a fatal crash. You could probably be able to remove any of the user folders that are no longer with Igloo,  any of the jobs that they would have worked on and then taken over by another designer would either be completed or another save file has been created by the second designer.

I am sure that in each of the user folders there are numerous jobs that are old and can be removed, these would need to be looked at on the individual level.

Hello Arron, I see the Job folder on one of our servers is getting a lot of space on the local for engineering users.

On that server, we left with 15 GB of space

Do you know, we need to keep it, or can we delete it and create a new one?

Hello MNP IT,

I have had further discuss with David Zimmerman at Web3 Marketing this am.
They need to revise the website platform, as it was not build with enough memory to function on the server with the amount of traffic we are currently driving there, due to the forms patients are required to complete prior to appointments.

We have continued to have website outages, impacting our operations, as patients can not complete the necessary online paperwork to proceed with their appointments and come into the offices in a timely manner.

To prevent further interruption, Web3 has requested our Shaw DNS hosting credential to act quickly on developing the new site. These creds should be provided to David Zimmerman at Web3Marketing as soon as possibleto proceed with the website work required.

If you have any further questions, please contact Melody directly.
Thank you for your prompt action to this need.

We have been informed by our Ricoh service technician that you will need to install the ProC5300s print drivers on all desktops / RDS units within PHS.   Currently it shows we are running a generic Microsoft driver which is not sufficient to run all necessary applications of our new printer machine.

Deadline for this is ASAP as we have a huge 2000+ mail-out happening

Hi Cori,

Can you please quote us for Qty 3 Surface Pros (with SIM card slots) with Keyboards, Chargers, Pens and Docks?  Also include 3  Monitors and Wireless Keyboards/Mice and  3 USB-C to display port cords (that is the right one, correct?).

I know this is a pain, but if you can make the Qty’s adjustable, that would be great – sometimes I just end up adding on or taking away, depending on the number of requests – which are all last minute.

Thanks,
Joey

As we continue to grow the functionality of the Epitome membership application, we’re going to need to make more changes to DNS.  I was hoping that it might be possible for you to delegate management of the epitome.edpub.org sub-domain to us so that we can manage records for that zone without having to run it through a service request process like this.

If you’re agreeable to this, please create the sub-domain’s zone in the Epitome resource group and we’ll be able to manage it from there (our staff are already Owners of that resource group).  We can worry about recreating the existing records for that zone, and you’ll be able to remove the CNAME for epitome.edpub.org and the TXT domain verification records.

If you’d like to retain management of the epitome.edpub.org domain, instead, I have a handful of DNS changes I’ll need you to make.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.

Subject: Possible hacked email?

Good morning,

Lawyer Yemi Philip, Eugene Erler and Herve Durocher received emails yesterday morning from “Robert M. Simpson” but no signature line and not received from Mr. Simpson’s DSKE email address.  I’ve attached the emails Eugene Erler and Herve Durocher forwarded to me.  Ms. Philip and Mr. Durocher responded to the initial emails yesterday and received a second email requesting they pick something up from the store for Mr. Simpson.  This happened once before with similar emails in the office, I can’t remember if it was Mr. Simpson’s name used last time.

Herve Durocher received a similar email from his accountant to his work email and responded to it yesterday.  He then got an email from his accountant this morning advising him not to respond to the email because the accountant’s email was hacked.  The first email to all three said:

“When will you be in today?

Kindly let me know, I have a very important request I need you to handle. Thanks. “

Can this be checked out?

Sorry Charlene, I meant this one  010421MNP but I think you stated you cannot add to it. Can we get the same price on 3 units as we did on the ones from that PO? Same customer.

1404481,NRCB,Mike Iwanyshyn,Mike Iwanyshyn - Monitor,"Hi,

I was wondering if I could possibly get a new monitor (currently have two).  The one monitor I have (View Sonic 2458; Asset Tag CA108) is fading.  The color has started to fade and the display has a “washed out” look, making it difficult to see and use.  I have tried adjusting some settings (to see if it helps, but it hasn’t and I hadn’t changed anything originally), but it appears that it may be on its last legs.  The other one (same model; Asset Tag CA107) seems to be ok.

Ideally, shipped to my house would be best, but I can go into the office too if that is easier.  Simply let me know what works or if there any questions.  Thanks.

Hello Vito,

I am currently on hold with MNP IT to arrange, but wanted to put you all in the loop via email. I am currently working remotely from home May 5 - 7, and NOT in office.

The first G Suite training is scheduled for Monday May 10, 2021 at 4:30pm with the Align team in the Hewes Kitchen/Boardroom. In my absence,I need technology set up for the ZOOM Meeting Training.

Tomorrow during our scheduled site-visit, could Ade or Lance take one of the old Windows 7 Laptops from my office IT cupboard and se t up and test in the Hewes Kitchen with the projector? There may be additional adaptors required to run the Laptop to that “Kitchen” PC, then to have Sean’s team project their training to the big screen. Im am strictly using the Laptop to be the camera for the training. We will use the telephone to connect to BusinessCloud for audio. Curt provided a quote for web cam/mic/speakers, but Tomas and I would like to proceed with this attempt first…

I need this tested with Teams, Zoom OR Google Meet tomorrow afternoon with MNP IT. I will be back in office on Monday and would like to run a test at 8:30am myself.

I am available via cell at 780.719.8202 today, tomorrow and Friday during business hours, while away from the Align office.

Side note…I waited for 15 min on hold with MNP IT and have ended up leaving a message regarding this email and planning for Site-Visit tomorrow.
Thanks,
Mel

Would you be so kind and let me know what is the current set up in the boardroom / clinic meeting rooms?

We would like to use this room to train our team to embrace google email.......

I understood that there was a projector that could be connected to a laptop which would allow us to project.........google meeting, zoom session or other method for screen sharing, so that would not be a problem. If you have a conference phone, then...",1,1,43,Email Connector,2021-05-05 16:51:44

RDS frequently closing

### Details of Issue
When I log into the RDS, it will freeze after 1-5 minutes then quit the program. This happened 10-12 times yesterday between 4-5pm, then was okay when I tried again after 7pm. Today the RDS has quit several times in the one hour I have been using it. Usually it will require me to enter my password to reopen the RDS, but sometimes clicking the icon automatically opens to my account when this happens.

I hope you have been well! Following up on our last conversation, our two new laptops have arrived. If you could please help me set them up that would be wonderful.

These are the names of the laptops:
DESKTOP-B3F3ILN
DESKTOP-AT1FPQQ
One of these also needs to be set up with Peter’s email (peter@edenffc.org)

Secondly, one of the desktop computers at our office (AT40003) will also need to be set up again because we are changing the CPU for it, so I believe it will look like a completely new set up. Once the laptops are done if you could please help with this as well.

Lastly, I have a question for you. Once the laptops are set up, we will need some of our current laptops to be installed with a new scanning software. The software company will install this for us, but we will need a temporary admin password to allow them to make changes to our laptops. Could you provide me with this information too? Thank you!

Take care Donna!

1403555,Murray Hill Developments,Alex Ettinger,New Computers - Set Up Admin Users,"Hi there,

We recently acquired two new computers from you, but administrator accounts were not set up for us on either computer. We have created our IT account (Eric Wiedman), and we will need you to remote in for us to make it an administrator account. 

I have attached a photo for you with the two MNP stickers. I believe those have the code you need to remote in and set this up for us (10438 and 10439). You can log in to these computers at any time, as we cannot continue our setup until our account is made an administrator account.

Is it possible for you to make a note on our account that the default new user account created for us on all new computers for Murray Hill Developments must be an administrator account? This is a recurring problem for us where you guys need to remote in after the fact to take care of this when we're trying to complete our setup of users, our remote login software, and other software our users need.

It does not look like a Phishing attempt – there were no links or anything like that.  It was not sitting in my outbox, at least not that I could see.  Please investigate this.

Leigh-Ann had difficulties viewing attachments patients send her.
When she is in the RDS, it indicates that she does not have enough memory to view the graphic.
Could it be that this opens in Window Photo viewer, or that she is in the RDS. No other TC’s have indicated this as being and issue, so I believe that it is her SHPK RDS only.
The graphic was just a screen shot of the patients dental insurance benefits details.

Thanks,

Hey sis you’re up bright and early!

Now would you be referring to the password that was provided to Ariane he for his email, and that will stop the forwarding? IT will still have to reconnect his RDS though won’t they?

Have you got a crazy busy week or would you have time to meet with me possibly Wednesday or Thursday morning? Let me rephrase how about whenever you have time later in the week?

Subject: This weekend's automated server updates

Automated server updates are scheduled for 2 clients across 2 locations with 2 servers this weekend. The list of clients and locations is below:

Igloo Building Supplies Group - Azure

Landrex - Main

This means that all servers for the above clients/locations will have updates installed between 1AM and 4AM Saturday morning (Friday evening) at the server's local time. During that time the updates will install and the servers will reboot, but maintenance mode should prevent false alerts. If you get an alert about an issue please confirm it is an issue. If it is a false alert please submit a bug report with Central Services.

If you'd like more specific information on the timing in the maintenance window you can find it here: https://nextdigital.itglue.com/1848012/docs/5219730#version=published&documentMode=view",1,1,41,Email Connector,2021-05-03 09:08:42

There is a QuickBooks Update that needs to be installed.  This needs to be done after 5:00PM, ideally one day this week (the week of May 3rd).  PRIOR to doing the update, please advise the planned date so that Linda can run a GL, so that we can ensure that the data did not get affected.

1401672,MHK Insurance,Michelle Rose,Michelle Rose - Teams app within RDS - Global updates or by-user only?,"MNP,

We’re wondering if the Microsoft Teams app within RDS can be set to globally update across the company or if it the responsibility for checking for updates lies with each staff user?

We’re still finding that with some public Teams that have been created, some people cannot view them or even use a code to join them. This seems so strange why there is inconsistency across the company with being able/unable to join or even see to join public Teams. For some people, this was fixed by doing a Check for updates within the app. But even then, only a few more public Teams become visible/joinable. So weird.

Thanks.

Are you able to come out next week to hook a phone up for John?  We have not made any move on a new phone system plan as his attention has been drawn to other challenges at this time.

Let me know if you can hook him up with one of those extras we bought.  I feel like there may be an issues that you noted . . . perhaps that we are maxed out for phone lines or something to that affect?

At any rate, let me know if you are able to come out and hook up a phone in the main office up front when you walk into San Rufo Homes.

Thank you!!

Hi Jeff,

We want to start paying our vendors via EFT as opposed to printing cheques from Sage 50 as we do today.  There are a number of things that I need to work with our bank, RBC, on as well as some software setup.

In the attached document on page 2 there are instructions on how to install the program.  It refers to C:\Program Files which we must store on our server instead.  I assume that we need a separate company set up for each of our Sage 50 company files that issue vendor payments. Would you be able to assist me with this step?

There is no huge deadline or rush to get this done, but would you be able to look at it before the end of day tomorrow or on Monday?

1401023,Lexus of Edmonton,Robert Watson,FW: Era and Snap issues,"Service snap issues and what we have found

From: Chris Pituskin <CPituskin@lexusofedmonton.ca>
Sent: April-23-21 2:52 PM
To: Robert Watson <RWatson@lexusofedmonton.ca>
Subject: Era and Snap issues

Hello Rob.

I have done a little investigation into the issues of our ERA slowing down at different times, and our service snap connectivity issues. I believe it is 2 different issues, but all seem to relate to the recent implementation of Service Snap. Regarding the ERA latency issues it does seem to be isolated to the UCD building. I had performed a ping test from hard wired computers in the UCD building to the ERA server 172.30.1.192. In the morning I saw ping speeds of 6ms to 13ms, and the ERA latency was low. In the afternoon I was informed that the speed of ERA was slow. I performed a ping test to the ERA server and I was getting speeds up to 400ms and then would fluctuate. I then immediately went to the main shop and pinged the server from hard wired computers, and the speed was 1ms to 6ms, which there is no latency. I did ping the server from Neil’s wireless tablet and the speed was fluctuating as high as 700ms.

Service snap has been a wide spread connectivity issue between both shops. I have some conclusions from the investigation.
1. Now that we are streaming video and photos to the ERA server I think we are now saturating the bandwidth of the wireless connection between the buildings slowing down the performance. I think the best solution would be to trench a conduit pipe between the buildings and run fiber optics. The conduit would also “future proof” the buildings for any other upgrades as we could now run cables between the buildings.
2. Lexus Service wireless was initially designed for our techstream and other minor devices. We have broadened the implementation of the Lexus Service wireless greatly, and is there enough speed and bandwidth to accommodate what we are doing? We could install another separate wireless network in the shops specifically dedicated for Service Snap and make sure it meets the needs.

I’m not a professional in this area but here are a few thoughts I had that our IT guys could consider.

A new desktop has been ordered for Michelle Bootsma but I'm assuming it will not be there in time for her Monday start date (May 3rd). Is there anything required to set up one of the existing workstations to support her, or can she just log on and go? The inventory suggests that 3382-CAL is on the floor and available so that's a likely candidate.

Due to the phone upgrades to optic fiber which is causing issues with the phone line communications  
 The panel will need to be upgraded to not include the phone line whether it is a dual path IP and GSM or active polling on the GSM  
 Thanks,  
So basically this means we will need to upgrade the communications on their dialer. All the possible adjustments to the communications on the landline were already done and still had no impact.

Hi Vito,

Would this scope include installation of programs such as Reflex and the procurement of any requirement licenses to do so, or the transfer of any software and related licenses to MDG for the hardware we’re purchasing?

Also, I just hired an new person for an accounting role today. They will start May 17th and work out of our head office (form home today, however). She’ll need a full workstation set up (MS 365, laptop, monitors, keyboard, etc). I understand we have no more spare laptops on hand so would need to order a new one. I also believe we’re out of MS 365 licenses as a company so would need more. Can we add this to the scope document?

Kind regards,
Kevin

Good afternoon Ade

I need to install a few programs on my desktop – mainly the General Ledger (for some reason, this doesn’t work on the cloud).

When I tried to install on my desktop, it said I don’t have administrator rights

Can you give me admin rights to I can install software on my desktop.  And let me know when this is done, so I can install

Hi Ade,

We have a new employee starting as of May 1st – Jordan Brace.  We’ll need to have a Concord email address set up for him (jordanb@concordconsulting.com), along with access to the Concord files (just the Concord – Public folder to start), etc.

We would like to have the computer that was in Dan’s office wiped and make sure that it is up to date.  We’re not sure if Jordan will use that computer or his own, but it would be good to have that taken care of prior to May 1st just in case.  I’ve gone through the computer and I don’t think there are any files on it that we need to save – but it would be good for you to also take a look to make sure I didn’t miss anything.  Can you do this remotely, or should we set up a time for you to come into the office?

Once Jordan is here, we’ll discuss which computer he wants to use and then have him contact you to get his access to email, etc. set up.  (Or should he just call into the call center?)

Please let me know if there’s any other info you need, or if you have any questions.

Thanks!

Brenda

Subject: Belmont program to send CSV files to LeadBetter

Hi Preeti,

We need access to LeadBetter FTP. I tried with one of my FTP sites but the program it is blocked. It works OK from my PC.

I am not sure if we (MNP) are Belmont IT support and can make the change to allow the program to FTP. That is why I copied Kris, he will know.

If it isn’t us, then please ask Belmont to do the same thing they did for program:
Server: BLMNT-AZAPP-002
C:\Users\sagert\MNP\BelmontCSVtoFTP.exe FTP to ftp.directcommerce.com

The name of this new program is:
Server: BLMNT-AZAPP-002
C:\Users\sagert\MNP CSV to Partner\BelmontCSVtoLeader.exe

Thanks,

Mario

The Newforma application disconnect and reconnect server G2A-Newform when using the Edmonton VPN connection. Sometimes it pings the G2A-Newform, other times it will say that it can't find the host name.

When we connected the user to the Red Deer VPN, the G2A-Newform server doesn't disconnect within the application.

Could be a site-to-site issue but there some more screenshots in #1399972. As far as I am aware, this is affecting one user so far and this issue started about 2 weeks ago for the user but it may ne affecting others who use the program on the Edmonton VPN connection.

Hi Peter,

The server isscheduled to be rebooted on Sundays at 12:15am (server time), and I believe it should not be in conflict with the patches scheduled for the third Saturday of each month (1:00am MST to 4:30am MST).

Can we confirm that the update did not apply? I see that a restart was initiated at 3:47am by a process (LTSVC.exe) and Windows Update install.

[image]

I believe the error you were receiving at 4:11am was due to a running service terminated as the virtual machine had been started back up at 4am (the alert was received after the WMS services were brought back up with 10 minute delay).

Thank you,

Hi,

On the 3rd Saturday of each month, Igloo patches the servers where necessary.  This is a new initiative at Igloo where we will keep the servers patched and up-to-date.  This patching will occur every 3rd Saturday and will be completed between 1:00 AM MST and 4:30 AM MST.  I am not sure if our IT people notified you we were doing this.

On Saturday April 17, 2021, we received the error below, saying there was a read error at 4:11 AM.  From Task Manager, we can see the server was restarted at approximately 12:15 AM.

Can you review your records to see if the Server Restart was initiated by your side.  The good thing is, we did not apply any patches or do any maintenance on Sat the 17th.

Is it possible to record on your side, that the 3rd Saturday is reserved to patch the servers.

Thank you,

1399356,Maclab Development Group,Maintenance,Maclab Development Group - O365 Backup Failure,"Hello AJ,

Apologies if I have the wrong person, but I have you as the technical contact for this customer. The O365 backup for Maclab Development Group has been giving us a failure for a little while now. Seems to be an issue with a SharePoint site.

4/26/2021 12:41:48 AM :: Failed to process site: https://maclabdevelopment-my.sharepoint.com/personal/tone_maclabdevelopment_com. Cannot contact site at the specified URL https://maclabdevelopment-my.sharepoint.com/personal/tone_maclabdevelopment_com. Access to this Web site has been blocked. Please contact the administrator to resolve this problem.

We’ve been seeing this issue a lot since our latest update and the problem seems to be that SharePoint sites are deleted in the customer environment, but VBO is still trying to pick them up for backup. If you can confirm that this site has been deleted, I will exclude it from the backup and clear up the error.

Thank you AJ,

Good afternoon

Not sure who to include on this email, It was brought to my attention that the main line for the Cold lake office just rings and is not being answered. The call did not go to a voicemail either. I called myself a few minutes ago. We Had a customer call Bonnyville earlier in the week in search of someone to talk to and to transfer the call as he had tried the line multiple times. Not sure if this was an isolated week with the recent Covid restrictions or if this has been always the case.

Riccardo can you confirm where the Cold lake main line is forwarded to and after how many rings, if at all? I had always thought after the 3rd or 4thring it was forwarded to Sherwood Park. I am concerned this is not happening. Or perhaps it is too many rings and people are hanging up after 3 rings before it gets a chance to be forwarded.

Thank you

Jerry Wilkinson - E4C - SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE)

Description
### Summary of Issue
E4C - SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE)
  
### Details of Issue
Discovered On:
▪ 172.17.5.58 (TCP/1433) (TCP/50393) (TCP/62270)

The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as
POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a
victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.
As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if
TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.
The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks without impacting legacy clients;
however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that
cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.
This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3
is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability.

Recommended Solution:
MNP recommends disabling SSLv3. Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV
mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.

Couldn't deliver to the following recipients:

How to Fix It
The address may be misspelled or may not exist. Try one or more of the following:
 Send the message again following these steps: In Outlook, open this non-delivery report (NDR) and chooseSend Again from the Report ribbon. In Outlook on the web, select this NDR, then select the link ""To send this message again, click here."" Then delete and retype the entire recipient address. If prompted with an Auto-Complete List suggestion don't select it. After typing the complete address, click Send.
 Contact the recipient (by phone, for example) to check that the address exists and is correct.
 The recipient may have set up email forwarding to an incorrect address. Ask them to check that any forwarding they've set up is working correctly.
 Clear the recipient Auto-Complete List in Outlook or Outlook on the web by following the steps in this article:Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365, and then send the message again. Retype the entire recipient address before selectingSend.
If the problem continues, forward this message to your email admin. If you're an email admin, refer to theMore Info for Email Admins section below.
Was this helpful? Send feedback to Microsoft.

More Info for Email Admins
Status code: 550 5.1.10
This error occurs because the sender sent a message to an email address hosted by Office 365 but the address is incorrect or doesn't exist at the destination domain. The error is reported by the recipient domain's email server, but most often it must be fixed by the person who sent the message. If the steps in the How to Fix It section above don't fix the problem, and you're the email admin for the recipient, try one or more of the following:
The email address exists and is correct - Confirm that the recipient address exists, is correct, and is accepting messages.
Synchronize your directories - If you have a hybrid environment and are using directory synchronization make sure the recipient's email address is synced correctly in both Office 365 and in your on-premises directory.
Errant forwarding rule - Check for forwarding rules that aren't behaving as expected. Forwarding can be set up by an admin via mail flow rules or mailbox forwarding address settings, or by the recipient via the Inbox Rules feature.
Recipient has a valid license - Make sure the recipient has an Office 365 license assigned to them. The recipient's email admin can use the Office 365 admin center to assign a license (Users > Active Users > select the recipient > Assigned License > Edit).
Mail flow settings and MX records are not correct - Misconfigured mail flow or MX record settings can cause this error. Check your Office 365 mail flow settings to make sure your domain and any mail flow connectors are set up correctly. Also, work with your domain registrar to make sure the MX records for your domain are configured correctly.

I hope Armand can help us with this issue as he helped us with email with attachments not being delivered to me from Charles this week.

Hi Armand,

We realized this morning that there was another email sent to me by a CarePros employee that was not delivered to my email. This email was sent by Alex Gervais on Apr 19, 2021. I have attached the email that he sent to me this morning (which delivered) which included Apr 19 email thread that he noted as sent to me but I did not receive regarding direct deposit info screenshot.

Can you kindly look into it and let us know why this occurred? I am concerned with the potential of other emails that I didn’t receive.

Thank you.

Hi David,
Sorry, I wasn’t able to catch up with you before you left the other day.
Were you able to get a backup image of the HMI Servers?
We would like to have these backed up going into the weekend when we upgrade the software so we have something to fall back on if it fails.

This is only affecting a few staff members but it has been different people each day and has been ongoing for about three days. They eventually access them, but I’m told it either takes a very long time (10+ minutes) or they have to try multiple times before it will work.

Unfortunately it is not happening to me so I cannot confirm the behavior beyond the reports that have come to me. If required please reach out to the users experiencing it to confirm the issue and behavior.

Currently the people notified of impending server updates is a random assortment of staff members (see attached).  This is unacceptable.  I have stated multiple times previously that notifications regarding server updates should be sent to myself (Lukas) and Bryce only at this time.  Since I am not on the current random list I have no idea when updates occur.

Well, you can right click my compute icon or This PC icon on your desktop and go to properties and see how much RAM you have on this PC. Check others and see if 1 has 16 Gig. I believe it may work but will be slowww until you can purchase some Ram and install it but you can ask the Field Service whom will be on site as he would know exactly what to do and answer any of your questions.

Subject: Re: Book Purchase Link

Hi Kathy,

Perfect; I was going to recommend   pd.aaa.ab.catoo. :)

Could you please ask MNP to set up this new  pd.aaa.ab.casubdomain and use the following NDS information for it?:

ns1.liquidweb.com

ns.liquidweb.com

I needed to have the final domain name to be able to allow the videos to show up, and have to apply it to each video, so can do that now and have it show up when the subdomain is live.

This will work really well because we can have this new domain live and have no traffic going to it so it is a better, more final  testing environment.

Thanks for the heads up on Module 11 changes. This all sounds fine.

Thanks, 

Susan

Good morning Ade,

I hope you are doing well!

On Monday, we have two new staff members joining the APPLE Schools team. In preparation for this, we need some support from you to get them set up with their emails, gmail and office suite subscriptions, and whatever else is needed.

The information for the new employees is as follows:
1. Lauren Walker - email should be lauren.walker@appleschools.ca

 Lauren will be taking Landra's computer, I have emailed you regarding this.

1. Cari Foster - email should be cari.foster@appleschools.ca

 Cari will be using her own computer, but she has agreed to have our protective software downloaded on her computer. This will be something that needs to be set up with her.

Can you remind us what information we need to provide both Lauren and Cari to support them with their first day setups? Do you have some instructions we can send them? For example, what do they need to do to first get into their email, ect.

We are also wondering what the additional costs for this will be for us?

We would like to get them setup before the end of this week so that they are good to go on Monday. Please let me know if this timeline works for you.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Thank you,

Nicole

Service Request - E4C - Enable FortiGate DNS Caching for all Locations
  
### Details of Issue
E4C FortiGates are configuring DHCP clients to use DNS servers in NextCloud.
We have a proven method to configure FortiGates as DNS servers, including caching/forwarding internal DNS requests to Windows domain controllers.
https://nextdigital.itglue.com/1848012/docs/6464813
This will reduce latency for DNS client requests and increase resiliency for when VPN links go down.
Please assign to FSTs to configure all E4C FortiGates with DNS Server and DHCP Server according to that guide, with a DNS Database for e4calberta.internal syncing from NC-E4C-BE01 (172.17.5.10).

Brian McBride - Enable Communication between Wireless Device and Ethernet Port 5 of FortiWifi60E on E4C_Staff Network

Description
### Summary of Issue
Enable Communication between Wireless Device and Ethernet Port 5 of FortiWifi60E on E4C_Staff Network
  
### Details of Issue
Ticket written by contractor: Nick Kalogirou of G2V Optics. (7806194836)
Overseen by Brian of Hallway Cafe.
Context: installing a horticultural light in the cafe which is controlled via WiFi from an app on a smartphone.
Network diagram:
Smartphone App --Wifi(E4C_Staff)-->Fortinet60E-->Port5_Fortinet60E-->LightControlGateway(hasZigbee)--ZigbeeWireless-->ZigbeeReceiver-->HorticulturalLight
Issue: The light control gateway has a red and green light on it, indicating whether it is receiving ethernet/network. It is currently red, meaning it is likely not receiving an IP address. Said gateway is currently connected to the back of the Fortinet60EWifi device on Port 5. I suspect that all ports are disabled.
Potential solution 1: enable port 5 to be able to communicate with wireless devices on the E4C_Staff network.
Potential solution 2: let us know what port on the Fortinet switch to plug into that would enable the hard wired gateway to contact wireless devices (like a smartphone) on the E4C_Staff network.

Subject: Spam Filter Change

Hi Don,

As apart of onboarding process we implement a product from Sophos that scans all your email before passing it on to your mail server. It’s a powerful service and very effective.

In order to complete the setup we have to do something called an MX record change over. During this period email can be down at most for 60 minutes but in my experience its usually much quicker in the 5-10 minute range.

When we start the service everyone in your organization will receive an email to register with Sophos so they can manage their own spam. It’s very important that people set this up as some email can get tagged as a false negative.

I can call you tomorrow to go over it in more detail but I would like you to start thinking of a good time and date to make this change. The sooner the better in my opinion.

Thanks Don,

Justin

Hi John

Chuck passed me your way .. thinking you could leverage CSP Level 1 status to get the most competitive Dynamics licensing cost for our customer.

Uni Financial has requested a quote for 55 Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise Edition licences to be compared against their incumbent provider. As I said to Chuck – this is among our more promising accounts in Atlantic for FY22, so showing up strong on every opportunity is key.

Are you able to help?

Hi Paul,

We have a user in the Epic Edmonton Property Management office that is having workstation issues. We’d like to have the computer reformatted. Are you able to schedule a technician to perform this fresh install? If so, can you provide me available dates and times? I will provide it to the user to narrow down a date.

Tasks Needed:
 Backup users data.
 Reformat the users computer with a fresh Windows (Windows 10 October 2020 Update ISO).
 Coordinate with Starport (myself) to get Remote Access to the computer and I’ll complete the Windows setup.

Hi Brian,

So can we get the reason why it was restarted rather than saying MNP is not responsible, so next time it doesn’t happen

Hello Amin,
We had Central Services look into this for you.
There was no patching or reboot from NextVision over the weekend for this server. WMS01 is on week-1, thus, this server was not scheduled for any automated patching or reboot.
This server rebooted for other reasons, of which, MNP was not responsible.

Hello Brian, can you look into it,

You have already discussed the timing with Peter about the restart; this is our critical WMS server

Subject: WMS01

Hi Amin,

The discussion on patching and or restarting the WMS server was, we were to make the server available from 1:00 AM till 4:30 AM.  I was told that there was no way to change the patching/restart time as it was part of a program.

The program David wrote stops the WMS services at 12:30 AM and upon stopping the services, an email is sent advising such.  I received the STOP email showing the services were stopped at 12:30:12 AM.

The screen shot below shows the server was restarted   1 day, 8 hours, and 8 minutes ago.  The current time is 8:24 AM, therefor the server was restarted at approximately 12:16 AM Saturday morning.  The Boot Time at the top of the screen show a restart at 12:15 AM but this means the WMS services were still running.

[image]

At 4:11 AM we received a Read Error from WMS as shown below.  I will look into what was happening that a Read occurred.

Amin, can you look into this and advise what time do we need to provide the server for patching and restart.

Thank you,

SAN Replacement - Hardware failing and unreplaceable on old SAN
  
### List any Service Tickets relevant to this project

### Who, within the Client organization will be responsible for approving the project/quote?
Riccardo
  
### Who, within the Client organization, is the best person to assist with scheduling outages, testing and approving changes throughout the project (project contact)?
Riccardo
  
### Are there any deadlines imposed by the client for this project?  
 No  
  
### Please enter any additional information that can be provided for clarity or history on this request
Per the ticket:
ES-P4100-02
Controller battery failed. This battery provides power during an outage to give time for cached memory to be copied over so it is not lost.
As per sales, the system is end of life, and spare parts are no longer available
Server warranty expired January 2020
We want to see about replacing the system with a newer model, potentially replacing SES-P4100-01 if possible as it is also out of warranty, but has not yet had a parts failure.
If no actions are taken there is the risk that if a power outage occurs all cached memory will be lost. There is also the risk due to no warranty of more severe issues occurring.

Hi,

Rob shares his calendar with both Laura and I and when I went on this morning, it shows that we have no connection.  When I went in to outlook on RDS, it shows that there are calendar events but they show up as busy only.  In VCC, they don’t show up at all.

Can you please advise?

Thank you ladies!

Description: April 7th, 2021 (Penelope Legacy SalesForce case: 00035240):
Hi there,
Our ODBC connection is not working again. This issue appears to be similar to one that was resolved in March.
I will let Carya's IT provider, MNP know as well given that this will likely be a collaborative effort.
Thank you!
Rob
----
April 12th, 2021:
Customer Rob and IT personnel Ken called. When trying to connect to ODBC, they encountered a ""timed out"" error. They will e-mail a screenshot of the error message as well as a screenshot of the information entered into the ODBC data source.
Update:
Hi,
As per our phone conversation, here are the requested screen shots of the error message and the ODBC config for Penelope at Carya Calgary. Please advise of any changes required.
Thanks.

Automatic confirmation emails from Cvent not coming through
  
### Details of Issue
We are hosting a digital annual conference for our members that they are currently registering for. We started getting calls/ emails from some conference registrants that they are not receiving the confirmation emails, which is automatic when they register for the conference. We decided to follow up with Cvent and it was brought to our attention that some emails have been blocked from receiving emails and as such, we need to contact our IT agent to add this to their DNS, to allow emails to be sent to them. Below is what was sent:

1394390,Next Digital Inc.,Chris Ippolito,Next Digital - estimated wait time,"Hi Dave,

Can we remove the estimated wait time feature? I want to add the reason for record purposes. We've had clients share that they get stuck on hold for an extended time. We've also been told that if the client hangs up and calls back, they get through to someone. This sounds like an issue with the phone system, which would be hard to manage.

The reason behind removing the estimated hold time is that if a client gets stuck on hold and doesn't think to hang up and try again or leave a VM, then we don't want them to hear an estimated hold time of 7 minutes for the next 40 minutes.

Thanks

Good morning and happy Friday!

I'm not sure if you are the correct person to ask, but I am having trouble accessing shared files - everything from the Day Plans to the Best Practice documents. I have had different people send me links, which I then save to my computer and then I am able to access them that day, but when I come back another day my permissions seem to have changed and I see the following:

Hi there, 

Our ODBC connection is not working again. This issue appears to be similar to one that was resolved in March. 

I will let Carya's IT provider, MNP know as well given that this will likely be a collaborative effort. 

Thank you! 

Rob 

---- 

April 12th, 2021: 

Customer Rob and IT personnel Ken called. When trying to connect to ODBC, they encountered a ""timed out"" error. They will e-mail a screenshot of the error message as well as a screenshot of the information entered into the ODBC data source. 

Update: 

Hi, 

As per our phone conversation, here are the requested screen shots of the error message and the ODBC config for Penelope at Carya Calgary. Please advise of any changes required. 

Thanks.

Hi Jeff,

The next time you’re on site can you take a look at the new ThinkCentre box you installed for me?  Right from the start it hasn’t worked well.  Each morning I have to unplug the power cord to get it to start up.  Often during the day if it has been idle I need to un plug it (and re login) to get it to wake up.

Is it possible for you check and see if we need to update Citrix Workspace on all of our RDS servers? I have a colleague on, RDS-12, for example who is receiving this message along with “Please run “Check for updates” notification”. The Account should be VertaforeCanadaCloud.com however I am not sure if you can save that name in each server for us. If one RDS server is affected then all of them should require the update. Mike Agu is rebooting our RDS servers at 6 pm tonight so if this update requires a server reboot it would be best to coordinate things with Mike.

CYBER EVENT REPORT

***********************************
Executive Summary 

================

The Cyber Centre received information that indicates a system believed to be under your control maybe have been impacted by a cyber event.
Event Summary 

=============

The Cyber Security Company PRODAFT released a security report indicating that starting August 2020 an APT (advanced persistent threat) called SilverFish has compromised several organizations across multiple countries.
The information provided in the PRODAFT report indicates that this threat actor focuses on recon and covert data exfiltration. The Cyber Centre does not have additional information regarding the threat actor beyond what is in the provided report [1].
Affected Systems 

==============

Below is a list of systems that were reported to the Cyber Centre as potentially compromised.    This list should be used as a starting point for your internal investigation.
//// DATA START \\
IP,Date Time,SystemName,OS,Desktop AV 

209.90.171.71,19:04:38 27.01.2021,SSA.INTERNAL\wbonertz@NC-SSA-RDS01,Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard,
//// DATA END \\
Columns:  

The following will help answer questions regarding the purpose of the different columns 

- IP: IP of the potentially compromised system when it reported to the malicious actor. 

** Please Note that this may be the internal IP of an employee if they are connected from home. 

- Date Time: Our source did not specify if this was First-contact or Last-Contact. The time zone is not known. 

- SystemName: Is <Organization-DomainName>/<EmployeeName>@<PC-Name>

- OS: Version of the Operating System reported to the malicious actor.

- Desktop AV: Version of the Anti-Virus software reported to the malicious actor.
Information Requested 

===================

-       Please acknowledge receipt of this message.

-       If your organization can share a report on your organization investigation efforts, please send as a reply to this Cyber Event Report.
Recommendations 

===============

The report provided from PRODAFT starts with the communication to the malicious actors C2.  Using the PRODAFT report, IOCs and the provided victim system it should be possible to start to identify what actions the malicious actor has taken.
The Cyber Centre recommends following mitigation actions for malware infections: 

Search your network logs for the traffic identified in this report.

Determine the system(s) responsible for the traffic.

Investigate the system(s) for signs of compromise.

Investigate your network for signs of lateral movements from the infected systems. 

Preserve all evidence and artifacts related to this activity.

Malicious IPs and domains should be blocked at your organizations gateway(s). Security appliances should be configured to ""drop silent"" so as not to provide any indication that malicious traffic (DNS, SMTP, HTTP) has been blocked. Logs should be regularly monitored for future access attempts.
It is recommended that you disconnect the identified host(s) from the network and investigate the host(s) for potential compromise.
The Cyber Centre recommends that victims of cybercrime self-report to their local police.
Indicators of Compromise (IOC) 

===========================

The known list of IoCs are available from this link and might be useful for your organizations containment and recovery efforts.
IoCs - https://github.com/prodaft/malware-ioc/tree/master/SilverFish
This list is updated by PRODAFT as part of their efforts to reach out to organizations that have been compromised to aid in their recovery.

Hi Luiza,

I hope this email finds you well and enjoying the sunshine.

Shafiuddin had a baby boy early this morning so he’s going on a two week vacation to spend time with his family. May I ask that next digital or rather our new IT company, I really struggle with remembering their name, forward all of his incoming emails to Ariane Monaco‘s email? I also wanted to find out if next digital would be able to provide me with a temporary password for his ear for CRDS account? I would only utilize this temporary password for the time that he is away.

I am unable to provide an end date for this change as Shafiuddin may decide he would like to take more time off than his original two weeks. However since his vacation will take affect immediately my hope is that his emails can be forwarded to Ariane he as soon as possible.

Thank you very much sis I really appreciate your support with this!

Hi Jeff,

There is an issue with our Sharpe printer.  I can no longer print to it and it looks like it’s a server issue.  The message on it says:  ‘Could not access the accounting server. Contact your administrator.’ I turned it on and off but that didn’t help; I also tried calling Digitex and before I got cut off (this happened twice) they asked if we were having internet problems and we definitely are not.  I thought I’d contact you in case there is something going on MNP can help with.

Thanks,

Carmen Davis, Accounting

Hey Riccardo,

By default as an organization you get 1TB of free SharePoint Online storage.

Then, per E3 license you get an additional 10GB. So right now you have 83 E3 licenses to equal another 830GB

Also, at some point probably during the migration we had licensing that totaled 294, which gave 10GB per license to equal 2940GB

So right now, your SharePoint is overprovisioned. At some point Microsoft will pull the plug and not allow anymore data to be uploaded to SharePoint. Unless you purchase additional space.

Policy violation or system error

How to Fix It
Check the ""Reported Error"" from the ""Error Details"" section shown below for more information about the problem. The error might tell you what went wrong and how to fix it. For example, if the error states that the message was blocked due to a potential virus or because the message was too large, try sending the message again without attachments.
If you're not able to fix the problem, it's likely that only the recipient's email admin can fix it. Contact the recipient by some other means (by phone, for example) and ask them to tell their email admin about the problem. Give them the ""Reported Error"" from the ""Error Details"" section below.
Was this helpful? Send feedback to Microsoft.

More Info for Email Admins
Status code: 550 5.0.350
The error reported by the receiving server wasn't specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. These errors often indicate the message violates a security or policy setting configured on the recipient's email servers.
If the sender is unable to fix the problem by modifying their message, then it's likely a problem that only the recipient's email admin can fix. Try the following:
Check the error for information about the problem - The ""Reported Error"" returned by the external email server can be found in the ""Error Details"" section below. This error might tell you what went wrong and provide clues for how to fix it. For example, if the error states the message was rejected due a Sender Policy Framework (SPF) issue, then you'll have to work with your domain registrar to correctly configure your domain's SPF records.
Check the error for information about where the problem is happening - For example, look for a domain name like contoso.com. A domain name in the error might suggest who is responsible for the error. It could be the recipient's email server, or it could be a third-party service that your organization or the recipient's organization is using to process or filter email messages.
If you can't fix the problem, contact the responsible party's email admin - Give them the error code and error m...",1,2,41,Email Connector,2021-04-12 11:25:48

Tom Steblyk was trying to log in to TEAMS this morning, and could not remember his password. He tried resetting it and couldn’t. So I logged into my Office 365 Admin and did a password reset for him.
It still isn’t recognizing his new password.

Is there something we are doing wrong?

Please have one of the techs that have been at VC to advise what equipement she would require for a Dual Monitor set up with a Surface Pro dock in the new space.  I don't even know if it is possible to put monitor arms on that particular desk, or if we should just purchase height adjustable desktop monitors.  Please ensure that all items required are quoted (Including the correct monitor Adapters for her Surface Pro S-11119 serial 020729103553.)  Please do this ASAP.  Thanks!

Hi Becky,

Thank you so much for the item list.

You are correct that the last information I need from you is the search criteria field before the server install. I will need couple of days to do the configuration on my side after receiving the search criteria.

1390294,Durocher Simpson Koehli Erler LLP,Linette Rasmussen,Adobe - not able to convert JPEG images to Adobe,"Good morning,

For the last two days when I print a jpg saved image only the top ¼ or less of the photograph will print and when I print as Adobe to covert the document to pdf it saves only the top ¼ or less of the image.  I can’t figure out in the settings in the cloud or on my desktop how to fix this.  Also, twice this morning when I opened two different jpg pictures they were converted to .note somehow.  I don’t know if it just happened on its own or if I somehow did something.  When I changed the tail ending back to .jpg O would get a message that the document/jpg was corrupted.  I think I’m the only one this is happening too.

Thank you.

Our initial investigations confirmed we are not seeing any issue with the wireless link. We’re getting the contracted speeds even with traffic on the link when we called initially in to Next Digital support.

As we agreed, we’d sent out our tech to the customer site this afternoon to isolate customer’s FortiGate Firewall. He appended his laptop directly to our demarc (EDGE ROUTER) using the customer’s static IP - 67.215.56.86/30 (Customer’s Firewall IP).

The results of the speedtest to various speed test servers attached below showing that we are consistently delivering the contracted bandwidth for CW Carry.

I am looping the end customer Blake, who also confirmed the speed test results while our tech was onsite before they experienced the power outage.

Please do kindly investigate your LAN; attached below are the results.

We will keep an eye on the connection and set the ticket to close after 24 hours.

At your service.

Afternoon Ryley,

Unfortunately, I’ve run into another issue, this one is regarding my email.

For whatever reason, I cannot search for emails in my inbox.

For example: Today I had to search for invoice from a company named Renegade Hydrovac. I searched “Renegade” and it said “No Results Found”, yet when I scroll down my inbox the emails are there. I was unable to even search by the exact email address it was sent by.

I’m unsure as to why this is happening, it seems to work sometimes and not work other times.
I would appreciate if you could resolve this for me!

Warm Regards,

1389852,Edmonton Public Teachers Local 37,Catherine Leblanc,Catherine Leblanc - Laptop Bluetooth and Mouse Issues,"### Summary of Issue
Laptop Bluetooth and Mouse Issues
  
### Details of Issue
Everything was working fine Friday, March 26, 2021 before Spring Break. This morning when I went to log in to my laptop after my Spring Break, the bluetooth mouse and keyboard would not work. I tried fresh batteries in the mouse. I tried removing and reconnecting the little USB thingy and rebooting. I tried going into the settings/system folder and connecting manually. The computer bluetooth is on. the mouse is on. They are not pairing.
When I took the laptop to work to see if my office administrator had any ideas, the laptop slipped out of the bag and the corner landed on my index toe (ouch!) and then knocked the wall.  The distance would have been about 15 cm down to my toe and about 15-20 cm to the wall. I turned the laptop on and if fired up and let me type in my password, but the cursor of the laptop won't work. I do not see an arrow. The bluetooth mouse still doesn't work of course.

I am now back in the office using my desktop to type this.

Just to clarify, Revit 2018 and 2019 are installed but not functioning correctly?

We can be flexible with when we work on issues: our regular hours are 7:00AM to 6:00PM. We can arrange for evening or weekend work to be scheduled but it is charged at a higher afterhours rate.

Revit 2018 & Revit 2019 – some functionality is reduced ie cannot view linked models.  I’m not sure what the issue is but a clean reinstall may be required.  Very difficult to carve out time right now where I can give up my workstation, unless it’s possible to do it during the evening or weekend.

My computer takes several minutes to shutdown (up to 15 mins), whether powering off completely or restarting. Sometimes when trying to restart, I have to hold the power button down to turn it off completely as it gets stuck shutting down. I also have difficulty waking it up when it has gone to sleep. I have no problems turning it on.

Please let me know if there is something I can try, or if we need to schedule time for you to take remote control (Priority level 4).

Thanks,
Laura

Hi Sales,

We have a new employee starting with Carya that will be doing a lot of graphics work, and working a lot in the Adobe Creative Suite.  We are looking to get her a portable device for use out of the office.  While we normally get surface pro’s, we are wondering if there might be other alternatives we should consider due to the nature of the work.  Is there a Laptop option that might be better than a surface pro for this type of work?  Please do not include Apple products.

Can you please send us a quote for a Surface Pro with SIM card slot – Pen, Charger and Dock, as well as two other possibilities as described above?
Please also quote for a monitor similar to the ones ordered on AAAQ20087.

Please make all the quantities adjustable.

If I could get this as soon as possible it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Joey

Good Afternoon,

I am writing to announce my resignation from Igloo Building Supplies, effective immediately (by days end). I appreciate the opportunity given but I have accepted a job more fitted to my personality.

Thanks you again for the opportunity at Igloo Building Supplies, I have learned quite a bit that I will be able to apply it in my future endeavors.
I have organized everything to the best of my abilities so it will be easy to pick up where I have left off. 

Cheers,

Attached is some sheets of paper that printed to my printer this morning.  About 30 or so of these sheets printed up when I walked into my office and I cancelled.  Not sure who or what was trying to print to my printer.  This has happened twice before.  It usually runs my printer out of paper and then when I put new paper in I cancel which is what I did today.

Keith & Michael,

I contacted Jerry Wilkinson with MNP and he has advised me that the entire Calgary office is using the 192.168.2.xxx subnet, not just the phones.
The Fortinet firewall is controlling the DHCP for this site so he will need to make the changes on his end simultaneously or shortly after I make the changes on the phone server.
Once the switch over is done in May then your system can control the DHCP options.

When you have decided on what subnet to use, please send it Jerry and myself so we can come up with a strategy on how to implement the IP subnet changes

Keith & Michael,

I contacted Jerry Wilkinson with MNP and he has advised me that the entire Calgary office is using the 192.168.2.xxx subnet, not just the phones.
The Fortinet firewall is controlling the DHCP for this site so he will need to make the changes on his end simultaneously or shortly after I make the changes on the phone server.
Once the switch over is done in May then your system can control the DHCP options.

When you have decided on what subnet to use, please send it Jerry and myself so we can come up with a strategy on how to implement the IP subnet changes

Hey Garrett,

I have spoken with my team and while they advise against having a password that won't expire, I have confirmed that passwords are set to expire every 42 days. This is drastically shorter than the 3 months that are standard. Would you be adverse to changing your password every 6 months? Anything more than that would need a waiver signed absolving us of the poor security practices.

I can make the change to 6 months at this time, I just need your go ahead. I will have to reset your password but we can discuss this over the phone if you call me at (780) 424-6398 ext 336. I can reset your password to whatever you'd like, so long as it's deemed secure enough but I just need to speak on the phone to perform it as we're not allowed passwords to be transmitted via email.

Thanks,

Dan Shaw

- Called the main line but received voicemail

- Called again and reached Garrett

- Was going to go through a password reset with him but he was on an non-domain joined laptop

- Connecting to the server were where his issues were

- Set his password to not expire

- Tried to get him to press CTRL + ALT + END but he was on a laptop keyboard

- Wasn't able to change the password from the server anyway

- Garrett asked if he can use the old passed; said that I can just leave the password to not expire and he liked that option more

- Let him know that I have to clear it with my team but I will leave it as not expired at this time

- Said he'd much rather this than changing it every 3 months

Mike Farhat solved some of our configuration issues with the Surface configurations.  We needed a surface, you may not.

Don’t reinvent the wheel.  If you have configuration issues, call Mike.  Stewart went through all of the bullshit IT stuff and it was after we sent it back Mike figured it out.

Soooooo…… Here is the thing…….

If you buy this, we are not getting this in addition to the full version of the Volvo software as we cannot justify both.

And I am not convinced that the Bendix add on for this version is going to fix the ABS issues that we go through every day without the Bendix official software.

I know Calgary and Edmonton use it every day.  (Stewart, you would know better but you have indicated you use Bendix every day!!!!)

So I am prepared to authorize…….. BUT…… You would be the only store without full Bendix and Volvo capabilities.

As an example, we are putting Volvo and Bendix OEM in our partnership in Grande Prairie.

Soooooo….. What do you want to do?

I understand the Volvo dealer here is using Jpro for junior Techs but they have to use the DLA adapter.
Also the Jpro is the recommended software to buy for shops doing Manitoba collision repairs.
I know of 2 shops using it and it is working for them.

So I feel that this is the way to go for the WPG shop

Laury do I have the approval to order?

Keith & Michael,

I contacted Jerry Wilkinson with MNP and he has advised me that the entire Calgary office is using the 192.168.2.xxx subnet, not just the phones.
The Fortinet firewall is controlling the DHCP for this site so he will need to make the changes on his end simultaneously or shortly after I make the changes on the phone server.
Once the switch over is done in May then your system can control the DHCP options.

When you have decided on what subnet to use, please send it Jerry and myself so we can come up with a strategy on how to implement the IP subnet changes

Hi Ade,

Marisa's last day is today. Can you do a few things for me to help with the transition:

1. can you have her email forwarded to me for the month of April?

2. can you remove her access to email or shut down her email as of Tuesday April 6th? Not sure if this makes sense

3. I will remove her from our google drive

4. can you remove her from our IT support list

5. Can you cancel her google account and microsoft account so we don't have to pay for this any more?

Anything else I missed?

Thank you!

Jenn

Subject: Programming Computer

Hi David,

I am currently in the process of getting some information together to update some of our Rockwell Automation PLC & HMI software at the end of April. The latest PLC programming software isn’t compatible with Windows 7 which is what our current programming computer is sitting at. Would you know if there is a good quality spare computer with Windows10 sitting around that we can use?
This computer doesn’t sit on the Office network so I’m guessing it will be a different setup than the regular Baymag image. I will need full administrator access to this computer to download and install all the software and licensing.

Let me know your thoughts or if you have any questions.

With best regards,

Hope you are well. I just wanted to touch base because I know some staff from MNP are coming to help set up staff computers at our new hub space on April 7. I also just wanted to ask for your assistance, as we will have our new printer being set up that day and wanted to coordinate that we will need some additional support for the staff coming from Toshiba. Would that be okay?

MISE EN GARDE: Ce courriel ne provient pas du réseau de MNP. Méfiez-vous des liens ou pièces jointes qu’il pourrait contenir.

Hey Jerry,

Not sure who / where I should send this, so hopefully you can point me in the right direction.

In our Calgary plant at 6969 55 St SE, Calgary, AB T2C 4Y9
We have an issue with a camera on our “Sorting belt camera”. As we don’t have an IT person on that site, we are checking if you / someone on your team can go on site and investigate the issue.

Thanks for pointing me to the right person and I hope everything is going well for you.

Cheers,

Rob Dawson | OSCP, CEH

Also, I am noticing I am hear fan or HD whirring, pretty much non stop. That and the network card has issues, so I think it would be good, to look at a replacement.""

One of our sites is having some computer trouble related to poor performance and a general slow-down of the computer. I believe I have narrowed it down to a software called Sophos that was recently installed. As a part of the software, it appears to include an anti-virus, anti-malware, etc. We believe that is causing a conflict with our existing anti-virus provided by LogMeIn. The issues started around the same time this was installed. Was this software installed by Next Digital?

Thanks!

I am currently in the process of getting some information together to update some of our Rockwell Automation PLC & HMI software at the end of April. The latest PLC programming software isn’t compatible with Windows 7 which is what our current programming computer is sitting at. Would you know if there is a good quality spare computer with Windows10 sitting around that we can use?
This computer doesn’t sit on the Office network so I’m guessing it will be a different setup than the regular Baymag image. I will need full administrator access to this computer to download and install all the software and licensing.

Let me know your thoughts or if you have any questions.

I’ve left voicemails for Shannon and Shawn, and I don’t have a contact number for Heidi. I have the likely workstations based on our inventory software, but I’ve been unable to remotely connect to them and update the Administrators group membership. It looks like the Infinity Metis staff work in a separate office/network so I can’t control them from the McMurray domain controller.

Heidi Taves - FCM-MTM-10201
Shannon Earle - FCM-MTM-10202
Shawn Meyers - FCM-MTM-L-7201

I’ll continue to followup with Shannon and Shawn, if they call me back I can remote on and confirm the settings via a remote session.

Thanks,

From:myles@cacorp.ca <myles@cacorp.ca>

Hi Amin,

I checked the firewall, there is a local-in policy on the firewall that locks external access down to MNP address only.
I’m looking into this issue to probably add your Azure address and give you feedback.

Dave,

We would like you on site approx. Wed March 3rd 10:30am / 11am – time to be confirmed for the site walk and prefield of requirements. At that meeting will be other trades required: electrical, designer, furniture, construction, etc. The above time is likely holding.

Please find attached the revised floorplan for Hub Amnor “SP-2 Hub Edmonton Consolidation Feb 26 21”.

For reference I have provided the Original IFT Electrical, as well as the NATG Data Run Designs and the North and South Marked up plans with run numbers – I think these are in your writting.

Please take care of this job for me on site. We will ship you materials as needed.

Your scope of work is:
-Data Cabling
-Data Relocates
-Data Numbering
-Data UNpatching
-Data Repatching
-A good flexible partner: LOL: whatever is required to make things go smooth and work out. I know this is your wheelhouse!!

I don’t need a hard quote as this work is approved. If I ship you materials then a new Service order will accompany that – otherwise, at this time this is the open ticket for everything required.

Some of your time may simply involve “stand by” to ensure everything is working when the employee starts the next morning. If Standby is used please mark that as this is a small data cabling job but needs to go smooth and if you spend 8 hours waiting around then simply state that and charge us. EG Work with Furniture team, wait for Furniture to be assembled Saturday 4 hours.

Questions please call 604-830-1830

Ryan Arnold our Service Coordinator will forward you the service order for this project.

Hi Chris,

I checked our mail policies and confirmed there are none configured to halt inbound forwarded mail.

After investigation into the notification that you received, I believe this is the result of a change Microsoft has implemented for all outbound mail a couple months back. The change prevents mail from being automatically forwarded from an internal email to an external address. For example, if you have an internal email sending you a weekly report and you have an Outlook mail rule that specifies to forward that email automatically to Fran - it will fail to send, giving you that ""message failed to deliver because the recipient's email provider rejected it"".

I have tested this on my end (see screenshot below) and confirmed I received the exact same notification when setting up automatic mail forwarding to an outbound address. Your IT will have to create an outbound policy to allow external forwarding for select users.

Our reports are still going out weekly, nothing has changed on that end. However I do see notifications from your mail server that the mail is being rejected:

fbodewitz@clac.ca (fbodewitz@clac.ca)
Your message wasn't delivered because the recipient's email provider rejected it.

Remote Server returned '550 5.7.520 Access denied, Your organization does not allow external forwarding. Please contact your administrator for further assistance. AS(7555)'

You may want to speak to your IT team to see if there are any mail rules causing this rejection on their end.

Hi Tim,

For your awareness it looks like she had a phone that wasn't working and she wasn't sure whether to push this back on her IT or back onto Telus.

It sounds like it's an internal network issue so I advised her to go back to her IT.

Hi Cheryl,

What is the serial number on the phone that was plugged in?  In the voice manager was a number assigned to that specific phone and set up for the Day program.

If Shae could provide a little more detail surrounding changing a data line to a phone line?

Currently who has access as super admin for the voice manager for the system?

1385405,Calahoo Meats Ltd.,Alana Brill,Header Anomaly Issues - Calahoo Meats,"Good Morning,

I spoke to someone at Next Digital on March 16th, in regards to Sophos quarantining ""Header Anomoly"" issues related to our Salesforce software. The specialist had reached out to me by phone and said that he had fixed the issue and made it so that all Salesforce emails are not quarantined for everyone in our company. Unfortunately we are still finding these issues. I have not had any quarantine issues, myself, since the specialist had reached out, however, when Samantha delegated a task to Ashley on Salesforce and an email was sent to Ashley through Salesforce it was quarantine (See example below).

Can you please assist in ensuring we do not have any Salesforce emails or Header Anomoly issues moving forward? We will need this done for the following employees :

Justine Berube
Ashley Corcoran
Len Smith
Alana Brill
Samanda Bauder
Bonita Kellington

James Armitage - MNP Tech - Server Manager on mgmt03 or rgw01 unable to display the RDS Deployment properly

Description
### Summary of Issue
MNP Tech - Server Manager on mgmt03 or rgw01 unable to display the RDS Deployment properly
  
### Details of Issue
Spinning this off from the RDS logon issues yesterday. Logon issues were due to an issue with RDS04, which has now been rebooted to clear things up.

Using powershell commands to manage the RDS Deployment is working, so we still can manage things, just don't have a gui that most would be used to.

Testing so far:
- Restart of the Remote Connection Broker (tssdis) service, no change.

A reboot of the entire server may be all that is required to clear this up, but would need to be scheduled afterhours.

Attached images show the slow load of the deployment, and then the eventual error received.

Hello Troy,

There are a few possibilities I have ran into in the past that have solved this error.

1.           You can set up your email address as a Microsoft account.  The attached instructions can help with that.
2.           You are already signed into Microsoft using another account.  To solve that you sign out with the incorrect account and sign in with this one
3.           Your email account is based on a service like gmail or SaskTel and you will need to use the true identity.  In this case, I can resend the invitation to the new email address.

If none of those solve your problem, you can send me a different email account that is linked to a Microsoft account and I can send the invitation to the new email address.

Thank you,

Thought this this worth looking at.  We could get kits on site to test symptomatic and asymptomatic staff.  Might be quite helpful for some of our programs – especially those that are seeing clients.

We have some Third Parties coming that need access to a computer in our conference room. However, we want them to have access to the Internet, but not our internal resources (servers, etc.)

Re: United Sport & Cycle - Alarm Communication to Monitoring Service

Again, I really appreciate you taking the time out of your schedule to talk to me today.

The following is a brief recap of the situation at USC:

United Sport requested that SysGen remove the old PBX PRI for disposal. It was thought at the time that it was no loner providing usable functionality and could be sent for disposal. As a result of the removal, USC lost the ability to alarm the building. As soon as the impact was identified, SysGen re-connected the PRI which allowed them to enable the alarm. However, the alarm system is no longer communicating to the alarm company’s monitoring service.

Telus was contacted but it seems that they will only verify the functionality of their infrastructure up to the building and no further.

As per our discussion, you are available to make a site visit tomorrow morning at 9AM to assess the situation. Jason\Lisa\Julie – can one of you please provide approval for Dave to make a billable onsite visit?

Thanks,

Hi Luiza,

I was wondering if you could check if the email account for Michele Dowling (mdowling@e4calberta.org) has been deactivated?  She is no longer working at e4c since end of Oct 2020.  She was a contact for several vendor contracts and they’ve been sending her emails including invoices to pay.  I don’t think they are getting one of those notifications when an email didn’t go through.  I’ve been getting calls after several months of vendors trying to reach Michele for payments and not getting a response.

Many thanks for your help! J

Craig just had his surface shut down with no warning, no way of stopping it (approx. 10 minutes or so ago??). It just came up with a message stating “Windows is shutting down” and bang, it was done.

Can you please look into this and/or advise? He was in the middle of a meeting and of course had items open that he had not necessarily saved yet that he was working on so it would be really great if we could understand why it would have happened and how to avoid it again in the future.

He had also rebooted his surface while working in the office last night (and hadn’t unplugged or moved it since).

Stay healthy, spread joy.

Thanks Shawn, I’ll work with you to get all of the information. For your info on timing, we’re looking to get a quote out by Monday the 29th to meet their budget timing requirements, they’re looking to cover any software costs in the current FY which is end of this month.

It sounds like this request is for a new build from the ground up and that would possibly require a Windows Server OS, SQL Server license (unless they already have this in place), and the Dynamics User CALS. Definitely different then just the desk side licenses. Let’s try and clarify tomorrow if possible.

Hi Shawn,

They do need the server license as well. Some reading I was doing said that that MS’s Dynamics server is licensed through user cals, so I wasn’t expecting separate server licensing. Please let me know if that’s not the case? And if so, yes I’d like to please also quote for a server (one for now).

Hi,

Just to clarify this is only for the deskside application license and if they require the backend server licenses, well that is a different story and we would need to quote that out in much more depth and detail. So please confirm as the sales team was under the impression this was for deskside licenses only.

Hi David,

We are at the stage of commissioning our new bulk bagging station and our goal is to start this commissioning on March 30th. Originally the company that supplied the bagging station was going to come from the U.S.  to our plant and help commission but due to COVID that won’t be happening. We will need a way for this group to remote into our Programming computer in the maintenance library and help commission the PLC. Would you be able to help us figure out a way to make this happen?
The IP Address of the programming computer is 172.16.201.28.
I am at the plant today so if there is anything I can help with while I am here let me know. Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.

If you do nothing, the domain will be dropped from our system, and your website and email will no longer function after the expiration date.

This email has also been copied to support@nextdigital.ca (the administrative contact for the domain).


Important note regarding the renewal of country code Top Level Domains (ccTLD): A very high percentage of ccTLD domains (.dk, .be or .lu for example) have no expiration grace periods.  As such, it should be assumed that once a ccTLD domain has reached its expiration date it will immediately fall into the domain redemption period.  There is a premium fee charged by ALL REGISTRIES for domains that have expired and have reached redemption status.  It is strongly recommended that all ccTLD domains be renewed at least 24 hours before their expiration date has been reached.  For more information, please visit the following URL:

We have CAT 6 in the centre of all tables, and it comes out behind our TVs.

We need advice in what setup we should be looking at for the micro rooms 2-4 people. We are thinking Logitech Rally for the big board room but the smaller rooms we don’t plan on doing something so grand.

Thinking USBC +USB A to HDMI (Mac + Windows inputs) to CAT6. Then on the TV end, Cat6 to HDMI.

The other question I had was if we wanted to mount a webcam on the top of the TV, or even a Mic Maybe? Is that something we would be able to do via the CAT 6 / Same USB A & USB C connector?

Any advise or direction here is greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

Hello Curt,

Could you please provide a quotation for supplying seven (7) Q6135-LE Q Series PTZ and seven (7) T91L61 mounting brackets?

Please include all necessary charges including insurance and shipping costs for FOB Destination.

Also, could you please let me know what other services will be included in this purchase?  We understand these cameras have at least 5 years of warranty period and therefore, if the cameras are defective during this period, how would you like us to deal with the matter?  Does Next Digital have internal expertise in helping us to troubleshoot the cameras before we need to ship the cameras back to manufacturer for further troubleshooting.

Thanks

1382613,Landrex,Alexandra Cevallos,Landrex | Alexandra Account Lockout / GPT Permission Issue,"Hello,

Alexandra connected with to us as she was experiencing Account Lockouts when working as usual in WVD. Upon checking Event Logs (attached) it appears lockout occurs upon attempting to process the following Group Policy:

The processing of Group Policy failed. Windows attempted to read the file\LANDREXNET.local\SysVol\LANDREXNET.local\Policies\{A7752498-B5CA-420B-9EB7-D5DEE8F69350}\gpt.ini from a domain controller and was not successful. Group Policy settings may not be applied until this event is resolved. This issue may be transient and could be caused by one or more of the following:
a) Name Resolution/Network Connectivity to the current domain controller.
b) File Replication Service Latency (a file created on another domain controller has not replicated to the current domain controller).
c) The Distributed File System (DFS) client has been disabled.

A test to connect to \LANDREXNET.local](file://LANDREXNET.local/) was prompted by a request to input credentials. Upon Alexandra entering correct credentials, access was denied, and the account locked out.

Upon checking security permissions on the gpt.ini file in question it appears Bev Jensen was added individually – she was another user who previously had the same issue as Alexandra. Alexandra was added as a read-only user as well as Domain Users (previously not applied).

It is likely this update will resolve Alexandra and future issues for all users. We are sharing this for information if the issue recurs.

Thank you.

Hi Raj,

Yes, most of the questions should except for the few that would require a yes or no answer like ‘do you have any upcoming appointments or do you have a leisure access pass’. I could see us possibly looking for a stat on the leisure access question in the future but for right now it is just for information purposes.

For the e-signatures I will work on getting the staff teams signatures collected.

If my answer wasn’t helpful just let me know and I can do a better job of explaining J

Hi Chris,

The majority of the staff got an email that is clearly a scam.  See below.  I’m not sure if it’s something we should be concerned about or if we need to do anything?  I also thought it might be part of the phishing testing you do?

I also wanted to touch base on where we’re at with the onboarding process?  I gave access to the network server to Justin about a month ago now I think and I haven’t heard anything since then.

I hope it’s ok that I’m contacting you directly because I don’t think we’re set up on the client portal yet.

Thanks.

1382214,MHK Insurance,Michelle Rose,Michelle Rose - Printing differences from Excel spreadsheet,"Good morning MNP.
We experiencing a strange situation whereby different staff using the exact same Excel template with strict formatting (i.e. row height spacing, font and font size, alignment, etc.) to enter data then print to the same printer and tray within the Edmonton office that contains pre-printed pink card paper, but the final result is slightly different for some people. I have attached an example of two different printing scenarios whereby on one version the text slowly goes out of alignment further down int eh document, and i the second example, all the alignment is perfect. I've also attached the original Excel template we're all using, just so you understand where we're starting from.
We've tested this printing process to ensure different people are both creating the document and printing the exact same way, with the same print criteria. I've even been able to test printing from my remote location (home) versus in the office. When I print the document, it is always bang on. But when someone of our staff are printing from home, it is not. 
My colleague Jennifer Bagu would be an example of someone who when printing from home, the alignment is off.
Do we know why this may be the case?

I’ve confirmed with Process Management, MNP does indeed have resources in both Cornwall and Yellowknife that can perform these actions for you.
We will need you to formally place in 2 tickets, one for each location please, with very specific instructions of what you’d like done at each location.
We’ll require the addresses for each location, and when the resources are on-site, they’ll need someone to escort them to the respective UPSs.
Please also advise of any (additional) materials the resources may need (network cables, etc.).

If the UPSs have never been configured before, they both probably have the default password. Please advise us if you know this is the case.

Subject: Citrix Token and Eclipse Web Access

Good afternoon Marc,
Below are instructions for accessing Citrix and our Eclipse environment. If you have IT support, you may need to engage them to assist you with this.
Username: ext_barrettem
PIN: 8019
Your STDID file (needed for RSA Token) is attached. The token can be downloaded onto your cell phone (using theApple App Store for iPhone or Google Play App for an android), search forRSA SecureID. This app must be installed first before you import the token from the email directly to your phone.
During the importing process, you will be prompted for a password, please enterSummer2020@
Steps you need to take if importing the token onto your laptop or desktop windows OS:
1. Download the zipped STDID file attached and extract the file.
2. Download and install the RSA SecurID software from:https://community.rsa.com/docs/DOC-73395, please pay attention to the version/platform (Windows 32 vs 64 bits) needed.

Once installed, run it and click onOptions, Import Token and import the extracted file from step 1, using ""Summer2020@” as importing password.
To access Eclipse, openInternet Explorer and go to: https://remote.bennettjones.com, then click onCitrix Web Access.
Use user name (above) and network password (to be provided via cell phone).
For ""Passcode"", enter thePIN given into the PIN field of the RSA SecurID software, and click on the Arrow to get the passcode generated. Use this to enter into the Passcode field on the Citrix Receiver login prompt.
Once logged in, you should see a single App icon calledEclipse Web (if not, you will have to click on the + sign on the left hand side of screen to ""add"" the App).
Click on the app to launch it, and if the PC does not haveCitrix Receiver installed, it will invite you to download and install it. Finally the app will launch, and user will be taken to the familiar Eclipse Web Login page. Here you use the same network user name and password provided via cell p...",1,1,43,Email Connector,2021-03-22 14:18:18

Replace Karen Berry with Lisa Walsh – Lisa already has a profile and Karen is reception, therefore cannot delete Karen. Can I delete Lisa’s current extension and then reassign her to 7483?

I hope you had a lovely weekend. I was just chatting with Cam and would like to confirm that when he retires, I will still have access to his calendar for scheduling purposes?

I do have issues,

My email will just shut down and reopen as im typing

A company told me they are getting emails back when trying to email me that they are marked as spam, when iv always gotten their emails before

Internet keeps blocking pages saying to many redirects even though iv cleared cookies

Had to install a new printer as old one crapped out and I cant make it work on any computer except mine so maybe network not showing or something

Couple tech computers are very slow to respond to internet even though we now have fiber internet

Hi Amin,

Something went wrong on the WMS server this morning.  Mica at WMS said some services were hung.   I am not sure if it is related to MNP patching the server, but I can see the server was restarted 3.5 hours ago.  WMS is up and  running and the users are able to log on.  The morning picking crew will have lost a couple of hours of work.

The WMS people will look into this Monday morning to see if this was related to the restart, that is, something we can prevent, or if it was a chance thing.

I will keep you posted

Thank you,

Hi Jeff,

This is Shannon Wyzykoski e-mailing from Guy’s e-mail.  When I use the icon you put on my desktop to connect remotely from outside the office I don’t have the option to edit the username to my own, guyg is ‘grayed out’.  I am therefore not able to access my e-mail.

Would you be able to change this for me?  If this requires connecting to my laptop I am available Mon am between 8 and 8:30am and then not again until later in the day. Call my cell if that works for you.

Thank you!

Good morning,

Our parts technician Robert Dodman was once part of this group and for some reason he has been removed. I talked to the parts manager and parts foreman and they have not requested that he is to be removed.  In fact he needs to be in this email group to assist my field technician with parts enquiries. Could you please add him back to this group and remove Amiee Carter from the Group, Amiee held this position before Robert but know she works at our Nisku store.

Cheryl,

I have copied you on this email because you approve who gets added/Removed  to e-mail groups, Do you know why Rob  has been removed ?

Our parts technician Robert Dodman was once part of this group and for some reason he has been removed. I talked to the parts manager and parts foreman and they have not requested that he is to be removed.  In fact he needs to be in this email group to assist my field technician with parts enquiries. Could you please add him back to this group and remove Amiee Carter from the Group, Amiee held this position before Robert but know she works at our Nisku store.

1380011,Baymag Inc.,Maint,RE: Plant Security Cameras,"Hi Codi,

The firmware update was successful and I confirmed the camera connections prior to leaving site.
I thought that the disconnected ones were related to the move, but looks like entrance scale, South Services West, Ore Pad, and Services Warehouse are currently offline.
I believe that those were connected thru the fusion building previously.. Will review my notes and see if I can confirm that.
I know in past, Chris had to get the camera’s reset (power-wise) to get it working.

Hope this helps.

Hi David,

When we finally got the control room all moved over and everything powered up we noticed some cameras weren’t working. The entrance camera is one of the camera’s that isn’t currently working and the operators rely on this one extensively to keep an eye on incoming traffic. You had mentioned you were going to flash some firmware and fix a few things up. I meant to follow up with you before you left but I must have just missed you. Would you be able to take a look at this for us?

Configuration Information 
 
All tunneling and routing, has been setup to support the VoIP Vlan at each location on our firewalls. 
 
-DHCP for phones at the new location has also been setup similar to what we have setup at CBS.
-QoS between the tunnels and subnets has also been setup to support the backhauling of communication between Crosstown used and Auto Canada Head Office. 
 
The Network for the ShoreTel phones at the new location is: 10.33.129.0/24
The DCHP range for the phones will be 10.33.129.101-10.33.129.199
 
We would like the IP of the ShoreTel SG-50 at this new location to be 10.33.129.51 or 10.22.129.52
 
Beyond configuration of the SG-50 any configuration on the ShoreTel Server at DSS (10.33.0.50) and any handset or configuration testing we should do with you onsite would also be require for this job.

Email Alias Not Working
  
### Details of Issue
Good afternoon! I started with e4c yesterday as the director of communications. I learned I had been assigned a long email address that included my full hyphenated last name (jhammond-thrasher@e4calberta.org). Lance Molnar, who helped to get me setup with my laptop yesterday, said he would create a shorter email alias for me that I could include in my e-signature and on my business cards. We agreed to use: jthrasher@e4calberta.org

Lance told me yesterday that the alias was set up and active. However, as people have tested sending emails to my alias today, they've received an error message that says: Message blocked. Your message to jthrasher@e4calberta.org has been blocked. See technical details below for more information. The response from the remote server was: 554 5.7.1 <jthrasher@e4calberta.org>: Recipient address rejected: Access denied

Can you please look into this and correct the issue so I can use my alias as my main address in my e-signature and on business cards? Thanks for your time and help!

Good afternoon! Please make three updates to my e-signature:

1. Cell #: please add my new cell phone number to my signature - 780.722-5063

2. Email alias: when I started at e4c yesterday, they had assigned me a long email address (jhammond-thrasher@e4calberta.org). Lance Molnar was onsite helping me with my new laptop and he said he'd create an email alias for me (jthrasher@e4calberta.org). Would you please: a) check to make sure the alias has been created and is now active, and b) change my email address in my e-signature to be my shorter alias address, not my longer original address. In other words, the email address in my e-signature should read: jthrasher@e4calberta.org

3. Please add the following pronouns after the name in my e-signature and before the green ""e4c"" in the first line:

Hello Bill

Did you see the email below and decide if you would like to upgrade the service contract/license? Also did you want me to come onsite and see if the AP is still plugged into the switch and has link lights? I would suggest that the service be purchased first in case that is what is causing the issue.

Subject: RE: Wi-Fi Access Point setup and what is required

Hello Bill

I was able to successfully update the FortiWiFi router to the latest firmware. I am now also able to see the version compatibility for the new Access Point, and add it and create a profile. The issue is that I still cannot see it go online. I was wondering if you could go upstairs and unplug it from the switch and then plug it back in. It needs to be plugged into the top switch, the POE one. When plugged into this one you will notice that it powers on and there should be a green blinking light where the network cable plugs in, as well as green lights on the Access Point itself. Once you do that can you let me know that all is well, and I can see about getting this configuration completed.

On another note, I noticed that your FortiWiFi no longer has it’s service/license active. This is not ideal. This is a security risk as well as a functionality limitation. Many firewall functions that keep things secure are no longer active, leaving your server and network more vulnerable. I would highly recommend that this be upgraded.

We can get a quote for this if you would like.

Regards

Subject: FW: Planned Power Outage for JLABS - March 23rd and 25th 
Importance: High

Guys,

Can you please ask someone in the team to open a ticket under Karen Simonetti at JLABS and get them to assemble a plan to handle the upcoming power shutdown.

I don’t remember what provisions are in place to handle graceful shutdown, restart and monitoring of the servers and network gear.

Per the note below, there are 2 power shutdowns
 March 23rd from 4AM to 7 AM, for main power only.  emergency power will remain available.
 March 25th from 4AM to 7 AM, Main powerAND Emergency power will be affected.

Even though the March 23 power outage will failover, you should assume a power interruption.  Although I’m pretty sure that we bought UPS devices for JLABS, that was a long time ago, we should investigate the following, at a minimum:
 is everything plugged into the UPS
 are the UPS batteries holding a charge
 How long do the batteries last
 Are the UPS devices monitored and updated with the latest firmware
 Are the UPS devices integrate with the servers as necessary for graceful shutdown
 Is manual intervention required to start the servers back up once power is restored

I’m sure this is just the beginning of a list of considerations.  Please work with the team to make this complete and send an update to the customer once the information is ready.  You should likely get input from Jakov to ensure that any network devices (Firewalls, switches and APs) are considered.

Can this be done before the end of this week?  The 23rd is 1 week from today.

Thanks,

Arek

1378838,NRCB,Ben Hsu,Ben Hsu - Edmonton office internet slower than home internet,"### Summary of Issue
Edmonton office internet slower than home internet
  
### Details of Issue
Both Fiona and Walter told me that the internet at the Edmonton office was slower than their respective internet at home, which took me by surprise. Fiona used the internet at work to run the Zoom meetings and it was slower than what she experienced at home. I understand that other offices such as Lethbridge may not experience the same level of internet speed as the Edmonton office. However, I thought that the Edmonton office would have no problem with the internet and running video calls, given that we have a speed of 100 mbps and no one is really working at the office.

Cyber Threat Warning Updated

TheCanadian Centre for Cyber Security (the “Cyber Centre”) has updated its warnings about Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities, which Microsoft has indicated are being exploited by a sophisticated group of hackers known as Hafnium. Microsoft reported earlier this month that U.S. law firms are among the sectors being targeted, and in a March 8, 2021 update advised that they continue to see multiple actors beyond Hafnium taking advantage of unpatched systems to attack organizations with on-premises Exchange Servers.

Although Microsoft has not specifically identified Canadian law firms as being targets, it is strongly encouraging all Microsoft Exchange Server customers to protect themselves through patches and other mitigation techniques.

The Cyber Centre updated its warnings on March 10, 2021 to strongly recommend that organizations follow their previously issued advice and guidance regarding the Exchange Server vulnerabilities. The Cyber Centre also warned that it appears attacks commenced in January 2021 and that neither interim nor recommended patching solutions will fully protect systems. Accordingly, organizations are encouraged to conduct a thorough analysis of any systems that may be affected by the vulnerabilities using resources provided by Microsoft.

The Cyber Centre included a number of resources in its updates, including Microsoft links. The Cyber Centre updates can be foundhere and here.

Microsoft stated that threats to organizations include access to email accounts by threat actors and “installation of additional malware to facilitate long-term access to victim environments.”

ALIA recommends that its Subscribers and their law firms take steps, through their IT professionals or otherwise, to assess whether these threats are applicable to their systems and determine how to best protect themselves.

I am setting up Calahoo Meats with a Salesforce CRM account and am seeing that when automatic notifications are being sent from Salesforce they are getting quarantined. The trouble is that the email address that shows where it is sent from is the staff members email address. So if I am in my Salesforce account and I set up a team member on a task and then select to notifiy the team member by email, Sophos quarantines the message and shows that it was sent from my email address

[image]

The problem is that it is flagging it because it is coming from salesforce and I'm not sure how to tell it to allow all salesforce emails to not be quarantined. This will need to be changed on 5 other staff accounts including mine.

Please give me a call when you have a chance.

Hi Jerry,

I hope all is well. I am sorry to contact you again about this. Our IP address changed again and we need access to the development server.

Could you please add our new IP address and remove the old? We will be switching soon to our new static IP so I am giving you that as well. After that there should be no more changes.

I know the project is closed but last night Shaw did some network upgrades and unannounced our static IP changed. If you have a minute could you change the lock down IP address from:

Hi Tom and Dave,
I hope your week is going well.  Are there any updates regarding the phase two project?  Are we still on track to have internet to the space by this time next week?

We are fast approaching the install date for the MRI machine (March 22).  The company doing the install is GE.  They have asked for a few things on the IT side to have the site ready for install:
1. Contact info for a senior MNP technician who will be available to facilitate internet and network connections the week of March 22nd
2. The attached form filled out.  I have filled out my portion for the PACS storage location and what the AE titles of the MRI will be.  Reading the form, it sound like GE needs two dedicated data ports with static IP addresses…these should be two of the 4 ports at location 18 on the previous IT map.  I need you to provide the Drop #, net mask, gateway, and IP addresses for the two dedicated ports, as well as the VPN information and to provide firewall exceptions for GE.  If you have any questions about the form, the MNP technician filling it out can contact the GE tech Mackenzie atMackenzie.turner@ge.com

[image]

Do you have an update on the hardware for the space (computers etc)?  I am hoping to have the hardware installed the week of April12th.  Is it possible to add one additional m720 type workstation with monitor?

Thanks very much,

LK

Last Friday I got an error when logging on to the cloud.  After speaking with James Anderson, he told me that it was a problem with RDS07 and that MNP would re-boot the server to correct the problem.  I don't know for sure that I was on RDS07, because when James called me I was not logged in.

However, I am now getting this error again.  (I logged in successfully a couple of times on the weekend without getting this error)

I am attaching the event log which shows that I am actually logged on to RDS06 and that is where I am having the issue.

Thanks,

Hi Jeff

*** VERY VERY LOW Priority for you ***

No need to get back to me today…or anytime soon.  Fit it in as able.

FYI: I went to actually use the “Sody Tracker” and “Sody LeaseTracker”legacy programs today and they didn’t work for me.
(FYI: Its likely the first time in months that I’ve tried to use them.)

Can you please set up a new user for Treydon Thiem?  He will be starting Wednesday.  He will be taking over the following emails:

ap@
admin@
receivables@

He will have access to the same folders as Mindy Dawson.  I will cancel her user once I have a chance to go through her desk top to ensure there is nothing there I need.

Side note, all of my folders in my email have disappeared…..

Hello Mike:
I wasn’t able to get my Mac issue resolved last week -you may recall the upgrade of Mac software that didn’t include keychain passwords or bookmarks coming over. Dan worked on it for over an hour (I think this was his third attempt), and how we left it was the ‘guru’ (his word) was going to call me on Wednesday at 1:30 pm. There was no call and no follow-up by Dan or the guru. I don’t think this is too complicated ,but it seems to require a Mac technical support person.
Could you have someone call me tomorrow please? I’ll be at my computer except at lunchtime. Then I am really busy as I have to travel the rest of the week. I’d really like to get this resolved. I feel like AMP Financial is likely being charged several hours for something that should, I think, have been a fairly seamless system upgrade.
Thanks for your understanding,

For some time next week wondering if could enlist some help installing some missing screwdrivers on a couple of the computers.

We have been unable to print from Accuro and when they jumped on one of the computers last week to sort the problems they tried downloading some screwdrivers however they don’t have Admin capacity to do this. Once these are installed apparently we will be able to recognize the printer in Accuro.

Apparently it is located in “Citrix Workspace”.

Will char this week!

You should log into your renewal management page on our website before this domain expires and either renew it or instruct us that you would like it to expire.  The URL is:

https://urldefense.com/v3/https://cp.easydns.com/manage/renewals/;!!CBowfw0!oLg34tQZ1nYGk3f6crwXfNO4T2YWODujsNh8puYIzHj-B8skkJ1_9uMUA5lRiusGtdn5$ 

If you do nothing, the domain will be dropped from our system, and your website and email will no longer function after the expiration date.

This email has also been copied to support@nextdigital.ca (the administrative contact for the domain).


Important note regarding the renewal of country code Top Level Domains (ccTLD): A very high percentage of ccTLD domains (.dk, .be or .lu for example) have no expiration grace periods.  As such, it should be assumed that once a ccTLD domain has reached its expiration date it will immediately fall into the domain redemption period.  There is a premium fee charged by ALL REGISTRIES for domains that have expired and have reached redemption status.  It is strongly recommended that all ccTLD domains be renewed at least 24 hours before their expiration date has been reached.  For more information, please visit the following URL:

https://urldefense.com/v3/https://kb.easydns.com/knowledge/cctld-country-code-domain-names/;!!CBowfw0!oLg34tQZ1nYGk3f6crwXfNO4T2YWODujsNh8puYIzHj-B8skkJ1_9uMUA5lRihilpZfV$ 


If you need to reset your password, you can do so at:

Also for extension 302 (Cathy Kiss) if we could wipe the voicemail and reset it so she can set it up under her name that would be great.

Hi Sue,

I’m sorry the WiFi is not working and you have to put up with the resulting complaints.

Given that the Aruba APs seem to work well in your environment in Calgary as well as all our other sites that have replaced the old Fortinet environment with Aruba, I would suggest we also focus on getting rid of the Fortinet APs in Exshaw asap.
Troubleshooting the Fortinet environment (even together with the Fortinet technical support) has rarely yielded any satisfying results in the past and would probably lead nowhere here.

Please try to console Mr. Spachtholz as best you can and tell him he can look forward to a much more reliable system, like the one in Calgary, once we switch to Aruba for the Exshaw plant.

The last two times Franz was at the plant he was unable to access wifi. I have attached a screen shot he sent. Can you please look at this and try to see if there is an issue? He will be back there again on Tuesday and will be quite upset if it doesn’t work again.

From: Help Desk

To: All NRCB Staff and Board Members; Board Members - Acting
Subject: NRCB password policy

Hi All,

I hope this message finds you well,
We would like to inform you that effectiveTuesday  March 16, 2021, the NRCB will resume the password policy that requiresa password change every 6 months
Please change your password prior to the above mentioned date to prevent any disruption to access that may be caused when the policy is enforced.
When you change your password through the RDS, it will take some time for this new password to take effect at the computer you are using at home. During that time, you have to log into your computer using your old password and use your new password to log into the RDS. If your password is not changed for your computer at home automatically, please contact helpdesk. You may have to bring your computer to your office to update the password.
When setting up your new password please adhere to the following password complexity requirements
 The password shouldnot contain the user’s account name or parts of the user’s full name that exceed two consecutive characters
a.    For example, a user with the full name “John Ma Job” has 3 parts “John, Ma and Job”. Since Ma is only two characters, it can be used as part of the password. The password can also contain Jo and Joh but cannot contain Job or John (parts of the user’s full name that exceed two consecutive characters)
 The password should beat least 13 characters in length
 Should contain characters from three of the following four categories:
a.    English uppercase characters (A through Z)
b.    English lowercase characters (a through z)
c.     Base 10 digits (0 through 9)
d.    Non-alphabetic characters (for example, !, $, #, %)
 Users who have changed the password willnot be able to use the same steps to change their password again for the next 24 hours. Contact the helpdesk for changing the password from the backend in such a scenario.
 Users cannot repeat a password used in the last four password changes as the system remembers the last 4 passwords used

Attached is a detailed  onHow to Change your NRCB Login Password that covers all situations for password change.
Please feel free to contact thehelpdesk for any clarification and or updates.

Subject:Info about the Microsoft Exchange Hack

Hi Tiffany Polei,

Are you currently using Microsoft Exchange at ADVANCE COATING SOLUTIONS INC?

 If not, please disregard this message.
 If yes, I want to proactively advise you of the possibility of a cybersecurity data breach.

As your dedicated TELUS account manager,  I have provided more details below and urge you to check on your network and run the patches. Please let me know if you require further resources.

As you may be aware, there has been a very severe large-scale Microsoft Exchange hack affecting approximately 30,000+ companies. Microsoft has come out with a patch for it, but the problem is that while the patch closes the vulnerability, it does not remove bad agents that may have already entered into your system. Prominent governmental agencies are already raising alarm bells on this.  https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-microsoft/white-house-cites-active-threat-urges-action-despite-microsoft-patch-idUSKBN2AZ0OQ

If you are using Office 365 through a cloud provider, you are likely in the clear for now. However, if your company is using an exchange server on your own device (accessing Microsoft's email, calendaring, contact, scheduling and collaboration platform via mobile devices, desktops or web-based systems), your data should be assumed as compromised and vulnerable. I urge you to run the patches and ensure there is no evidence of being hacked on your network. The only way to achieve this is to employ aggressive testing and scanning to detect any bad agents within your systems.

Any compromised networks still have time to recover from the attack, but would have to act fast. “A couple hundred guys are exploiting them as fast as they can, stealing data and installing other ways to return later.” Please do not hesitate to reach out should you require assistance – TELUS has the expertise and solutions to help.

Should this spark any urgency in reviewing your current cyber security posture or migration of company data to the cloud, I would be happy to have a quick call with you or send you more information.

Hello again Mike:

Sorry to be reaching out again to you, but I am still having some unresolved issues from ten days ago when Dan and I worked together to upgrade the operating system on my MacBook Air. (I realize that NEXT MNP is a PC enterprise and so Mac issues may be less familiar). Can you advise me how to proceed with this? Should I resume to work with Dan or work with someone else? I have outlined two problems I am having currently below. The first one is really impeding my work so I am hoping to get this resolved very soon.

(Tomorrow I am free anytime at 10 am and until 2 pm).

Thanks, and here are my issues below:

Best Regards,

Patricia Markin

In upgrading from Sierra to Catalina, I seem to have lost my keychain of passwords. I was able to re-establish a lot of them myself just by inputting them again. But one that is being difficult is Office 365. I can’t activate Office, as it asks me to do, and when I try to ‘recover my account’ it is not recognizing my name or email address - it says I don’t exist.  Here is a screen shot trying to open Excel:

[image]

Then with other accounts I have, I can’t get the password manager  to save the password, and have to input it and my email address each time. This screen shot is from a yoga subscription I have. I’m not sure if you can see where it asks me to save my password; usually I would say yes and then it would automatically be inputted, but it keeps asking me this every time I log in.

Hi Mike:

Thank you for your help earlier this week. I worked with Ken and he managed to partly resolve my issue (which involved re-establishing a backup system after upgrading to the Catalina operating system).

Ken explained to me that he was not ‘a Mac guy’ but that he would try to figure it out. That is most often the opening conversation I have with one of your tech team. I am most grateful for their help. But I have found that, with them having to educate themselves during our session, the sessions ttake longer and sometime follow-up calls are required. Is there a way that I can connect with one of your Mac people, even if I have to wait for them to be free? That would, I think, lessen AMP Financial’s expense, and help me with the time factor. If so, would it be possible to have their names so I can ask directly for them?

With thanks,

Patricia Markin

Email through distribution group to External contacts blocked
  
### Details of Issue
We have a sharepoint site setup to send email alerts to various contacts whenever content is added to the site. These email alerts are being received internally but any external contacts do not receive the email alerts.

I look in the exchange tracking logs and it appears that sophos is blocking the email to external contacts. I've attached a spreadsheet of some failures with the problem rows highlighted. This seems to be occuring for all the distibution groups that have external email contacts.

In the attached example the emails come from the sharepoint site  -
 spalerts@itutility.net which then send the email alert to our distribution group alert_sedationinadentaloffice@adaandc.com. The alert email arrives in our internal mailboxes but none of the external contacts (danielmark281@hotmail.com, hawn.higashi@gmail.com or seanbhasin@gmail.com) receive the email.
The stated error is ""LED=550 5.7.1 Command rejected"" from Sophos Spam.
What do we need to do to allow all of these emails( not just to this distribution group but all) through? Can we whitelist spalerts@itutility.net?

Cyber Advisory Notice

[image]

March 8, 2021

The Lloyd Sadd Team wishes to advise all insureds of a critical cyber vulnerability. Microsoft has released emergency out-of-band security updates for most Microsoft Exchange versions that fix four newly-detected vulnerabilities actively exploited in targeted attacks.

Why is this important?

These four new vulnerabilities are chained together to gain access to Microsoft Exchange servers, steal emails, and plant further malware for increased access to the network. There has already been widespread exploitation of these vulnerabilities, which is leading to compromised company networks. These attacks appear to have started as early as January 6, 2021.

What can policyholders do to protect themselves?

Microsoft recommends prioritizing updates on Exchange Servers that are externally facing, but all affected Exchange Servers should be updated.

If your organization utilizes Microsoft Exchange 2013, 2016 or 2019, we urge you to contact your Exchange and patch management administrators – whether in-house or a managed service provider – and ensure these patches are installed immediately.

Where can I find more information?

More details from Microsoft on patching and a workaround can be found here .

Additional information on the vulnerability can be found here .

Thanks for your time and attention,

Sincerely,

Lloyd Sadd Insurance Brokers Ltd.

Please advise on this one.  This distribution group should not have been removed.

It was called Edmonton Rentals.
If anything the name only had to be changed on it to CLLE Rentals.  Can you please confirm as to where the emails are going as the employees have not received anything all day.
Please see below list of employees that need to be on it.

Please advise as to when this is fixed.

Cyber Advisory Notice

[image]

March 8, 2021

The Lloyd Sadd Team wishes to advise all insureds of a critical cyber vulnerability. Microsoft has released emergency out-of-band security updates for most Microsoft Exchange versions that fix four newly-detected vulnerabilities actively exploited in targeted attacks. 

Why is this important?
These four new vulnerabilities are chained together to gain access to Microsoft Exchange servers, steal emails, and plant further malware for increased access to the network. There has already been widespread exploitation of these vulnerabilities, which is leading to compromised company networks. These attacks appear to have started as early as January 6, 2021. 

What can policyholders do to protect themselves? 
Microsoft recommends prioritizing updates on Exchange Servers that are externally facing, but all affected Exchange Servers should be updated.

If your organization utilizes Microsoft Exchange 2013, 2016 or 2019, we urge you to contact your Exchange and patch management administrators – whether in-house or a managed service provider – and ensure these patches are installed immediately. 

Where can I find more information?
More details from Microsoft on patching and a workaround can be found here .
Additional information on the vulnerability can be found here .

Thanks for your time and attention,

The CDD calendar was shared with me, however I do not believe that adding it through sharing was the correct way to do it - as it is not updating. I believe it may have to be added from the public folder properly, for it to sync up.

Can we get someone to do a check on Mark Zutz’s computer?
He is still running an old version of Windows, and the computer seems slow.

I suspect an update to the latest version of Windows is in order, however, I do not know if the machine itself is in good order.
His hard drive is also maxed out for space.

If the computer performance issues can be fixed with a windows update, and perhaps a cleanout of old files, etc, let me know.
If not, it might be time for an update.

- Access required for adding the treasurer access to Sage accounting?

 Terry Snow for IAS- 

 I need to be able to get remote access to the computer or laptop

 Someone needs to download the go to assist app (I send it via email or direct them to the go to assist site when we talk)

 The Computer or device needs to be connected to the network

 The user logged onto the Computer need to have local admin rights

 The user needs to have rights to the Sage directory on the Server

- Basically what you need to do and then we can see about what access to provide.
 If you IT person can access the computer externally and connect me to the Computer and download the go to assist then no one would need to be physically at the workstation.

Keep working hard to flatten the curve! We can do it together!!

Subject: Training Calendar Email;

Hello all,
I would like to chat with someone about access and better use of our Carya Training Calendar email at Carya.

I would like all staff to have access to this calendar, read access for sure.  I think that is the simple part.  I also want staff to be able to click on a link that will be in the calendar meeting that will then take them to a link to sign up for training.

So for example:

I want staff to be able to see that on April 7 there is a Brain Story Training from 9 – 12.  There is a link in the calendar meeting in Outlook that I want staff to be able to click on to get to the registration site.  I have put a test sample in the Carya Training Calendar for reference.

Thanks for the call and helping sort this out!

Cell Phone Set Ups - approx 8 per week
  
### Details of Issue
I am currently booking appointments with Staff for them to come in and pick up their new cell phones on Wed March 10th, and Thurs Mar 11th .  I am giving them specific times to come in, so that they don’t all show up at once.  I think we will try to do 8 phones per week until they are all done.  However this means that one of you will need to be here for our scheduled bench times, and not be late.  

At their appointment, you will need to: 
-	Transfer their phone data as requested. 
-	In order to swap the numbers to the new SIM card you will need to email Clearwest at  helpdesk@clearwest.ca with the phone number and new SIM card number (on the box).  They have already prepped for this so the swap should be quick. 
-	Put the case on their new phone 
o	keep the box and put their old phone in it 
o	Make sure you have the unlock code for the old phone, as you will need it to factory reset the old phone and remove the Google Account from the device. 

Thanks!!

HI Vito,
The quote is only for the 9 employees, this is for when they log into the RDS there would be a 2-factor authenticator.
This would involve an APP on their phone or is a text sent to their phone.  Can you explain a bit more how this works.
The RDS is only being used by 6/7 as the others are using sharecloud.

What about the 12 directors with email only?  They do not need this system.

Ryley and Lyndon,

I am not sure of the procedure for communication re IT issues so please provide direction if there are specific procedures to follow to report an issue.

Each day between 3 and 4 the performance of our systems seems to decrease significantly. People’s systems are freezing or we are getting kicked out of applications or things are very very slow.

Are you able to investigate and determine why this is happening consistently?

Hi Ade,

We need to purchase a printer for Jenn for when she returns. Before we start to research printers, I wanted to reach out and see if you have any recommendations or suggestions. I know in the past we have gone through MNP to purchase a computer, so I am not sure if we can also go through you to purchase a printer or not?

We do have some criteria for the printer, it must be:

1. Small
2. Wireless
3. Able to scan
4. Requires relatively cheap/affordable ink

Please let me know if this is something you can help with or if you have any suggestions in general.

Thank you,

Nicole

We terminated Paul Alberto’s email address end of January. I have had customers reach out to me that they have emailed Paul and haven’t heard back from him. It looks like they are not getting a bounce back when they email him.

I tried testing it. When I email fromshubhneetl@metalfab.ca... I got a bounce back. When I tried from my personal email, I did not.

Can we make it so that a any sender gets a bounce back when they email him? If so, can it can say, “Please note that Paul no longer works for Metal Fabricators. Please send  you request to sales@metalfab.ca” ?

Please let me know.

You can speak with Fidelis – 780-665-3241 for more information – site contact etc.

Customer had a previous service call for this printer – S0288012  and was believing that the technician had to return for parts.

It sounds like they may have a streaking problem on the printer, and that the tech possible mentioned that they needed a printhead.
There are no notes in the last service call to confirm what part is required.

Can you open a call and have the technician call the customer and explain what part they require, if they do, or if he needs to go onsite to see what the problem is.

Thank you

Alert Notification
Immediate  Action Required To Apply The On Premises MS Exchange Patches 
March 03, 2021 11:30 AM EST

DearMike,
 

We are contacting you to alert you to Microsoft’s release of patches for multiple different on-premises Microsoft Exchange Server zero-day vulnerabilities that are being exploited by a nation-state affiliated group.
The vulnerabilities exist in on-premises Exchange Servers 2010, 2013, 2016, and 2019.  Exchange Online is not affected. We wanted to ensure you were aware of the situation and would ask that you help drive immediate remediation steps.
Specifically, to minimize or avoid impacts of this situation,Microsoft highly recommends that you take immediate action to apply the patches for any on-premises Exchange deployments you have or are managing for a customer or advise your customer of the steps they need to take. The first priority being servers which are accessible from the Internet (e.g., servers publishing Outlook on the web/OWA and ECP).

To patch these vulnerabilities, you should move to the latest Exchange Cumulative Updates and then install the relevant security updates on each Exchange Server.
 You can use the Exchange Server Health Checker script, which can be downloaded from GitHub (use the latest release).
 Running this script will tell you if you are behind on your on-premises Exchange Server updates (note that the script does not support Exchange Server 2010).
 We also recommend that your security team assess whether or not the vulnerabilities were being exploited by using the Indicators of Compromise we sharedhere.
We are committed to working with you through this issue. Please let me know if you need additional help.
If you have questions, please Contact us

Ema was attempting to log into the Mitek Transfer Center app, launched through the Start menu.  It is more of an Add on than part of the Mitek program.  This is the error that displays on her screen.  
[image]

She has already restarted her computer once, but it didn't seem to work.  Is this something that Fidelis or MNP can correct remotely, or is this more of a Mitek tech support question?? You can correspond with Ema via email or teams on this, I just wanted to word it as clear as i could on her behalf.

Thank you in advance,

1371947,Scarborough Toyota,Rameela Ratnavarathan,Scarborough Toyota - Phone issues (Calls dropping and bouncing),"Good Morning Dave, 
 
This email is in regards to sales calls dropping and bouncing to other sale representatives. 
 
As of yesterday, I had more employees not only from sales but in accounting have the same issue where the calls drop after a ring and get transferred elsewhere. I am not sure if it is an issue with the phone or if it is an issue with the line. I haven't swapped phones yet with the reception phone because they are the main switchboard where all the calls come through but also because I am still searching for a phone to replace and test. In the meantime, is there anything that can be done in regards to calls dropping after a ring for other employees.

To clarify for you, the answer is yes. Without this bundle you are most definitely vulnerable to security risks. This renewal is for your Fortigate 61E firewall that is in place at Alberta Beach - Head Office.

Kindly note that your Fortigate 61Eprovides product updates, technical support and most importantly security management features, that protect your network environment. If this unit is not renewed your present security features will be limited in functionality. We do recommend renewing this support, in order to help prevent a cyber event from impacting your business operations.

I hope this information helps to clarify things for you.

Thank you,
Cori

Vijay,

Sorry for your inconvenience.
I will need to connect with your IT person and have them log me into the same machine that you are getting the error from.
Last week I thought the error was caused by the Report Designer License not having and activation code but when they went to enter it, the code was already there.
I will also require the User and password you are using to log into Sage when you get the error so I can test and troubleshoot properly.

Thanks & have a great day!

Hi Vijay,

I understand the frustration, and sincerely apologise for any inconvenience.

You previously confirmed to me in January that the report was okay, and if you needed any more changes you would let us know, so I assumed this access issue caused by SI License was a new development.

We will work with Sage to get this access issue resolved, but will also need you to approve for Your IT providers to grant Debra access to your Sage Environment, so she can work with Sage to ensure the SI license is active and you are able to run the customized reports successfully.

Again I do apologize for all inconveniences.

Thanks

Hi again Rhonda.

So from what I can see it tells me I cannot reset my password. I have to contact the administrator and they can reset it. I’m thinking that is maybe where the problem is. Maybe my password did get reset and I never saved the new one. I definitely cannot log on with the one I was originally given. Have someone contact me please.

Thankyou.

Hello Mike:
I am Patricia Markin, and I am part of the AMP Financial Inc. account for technical support from Next MNP.
I am a Mac user, using a MacBook Air, at home, and not connected to a network (except for a printer).I realise that Next is primarily a Windows PC focused company, but your tech support people have been kind enough to help me with issues as they have arisen. My question is: is there a particular person(s) I should work with, who may be quite familiar with the Mac platform? I ask because I have found at times that the support people have had to do considerable research and trial and error to resolve issues. Again, I am grateful for everyone’s support!
On Tuesday, I would like to speak to someone to review how I am backing up my data, to ensure that everything is working well. (I am just starting a large project with a photo archivist consultant and she asked me to ensure all is well with my back-ups).Can you advise me on who I should speak to? I am available tomorrow morning from 10 am - 12 pm if that might work for a call.
Thanks very much!

I hope you had a lovely weekend!
I wanted to let you know that I tried my very best to track down the zero spam license confirmation for your records however it seems as though Zerospam does not provide one.

The only true confirmation that can really be provided to you is the invoice you receive from us which should have included the purchase of your Zerospam.
I do apologize that I do not have a concrete license confirmation email and/or document to provide. I do hope that your invoice form us can suffice as confirmation.

I need to escalate the issues:

-          When I closed the ticket I had asked to allow macro enabled to prevent this to happen , and I was told that everything was good.
-          Funder sent an email couple weeks to the following recipient:
§  Barb Spencer <BSpencer@e4calberta.org>;
§  Sabrina Sheaves <SSheaves@e4calberta.org>;
§  Marisa Redmond <MRedmond@e4calberta.org>
However they did not receive the new funding and we can lose $14M contract.

They looked into their Sophos and did not find any email from the funder.

This has to be solved ASAP.

Example:

Barb Spencer e4c ceo, just received a new email from the funder using her personal email, she tried to forward to her e4c email and fail she did not receive the email. Once she removed the excel doc. that was attached to the email she was able to receive the email from the funder.

We cannot ask our funders to change their docs because we can’t receive, we must be able to receive regardless. I need his to be look at ASAP. Call me at 780-886-8787 if you have any questions.

Thanks

Subject: RE: Ticket #1347176/Luiza Coelho - Execel format Waiting on Client

Hello Luiza

They are able to open different versions that I have sent that are not macro enabled.

But we have a good example from last week where the funder sent us a time sensitive excel document on Monday that was macro enabled and we weren’t able to receive it until Friday after they sent it to Barb’s and I personal email.

When I talked to next digital originally they said that to prevent this from happening e4c would need to make the decision to allow macro enabled documents. They said it was an all or nothing situation.

Thanks

Hi Sabrina,

Just following up in regards the excel format, did you ask the funder to test if the doc. opens on standard Excel Workbook instead of the current Excel Macro-Enabled WorkBook?

Good Afternoon –

Our label printer has been needing a part for years and I would like to get it arranged. I’m not sure who to contact for this label printer as Sri was always the one to set up the appointments for servicing. Do you have their contact information, or can you arrange an appointment with them to come look at it to see the piece we need so they can order it?

Let me know thanks

We have a single machine, X-5739, that we repurposed for our contracted instructors to use at the ACSA office. I just updated the machine but it has an old (2018) installation of Java Runtime environment on it that I can't update or remove.  The computer also has Adobe Captivate installed and that should be removed.

I would like to request that someone remove the Java program (it is not required) and Captivate. A safe time to do this would be when it is not in use after Wednesday of this week. I will instruct everyone to leave the system on.

1371235,NRCB,Amanda Cundliffe,Update on Ticket#1291332 - Julie Wrights iPhone set-up,"Hi Jafaru,
Late last year we had a large order of new iPhones for several field services staff. As far as I know we cleared up all of the set-ups (associated with this ticket), except Julie Wright’s. It’s my understanding that a new ticket was created for her set-up, as she had to be moved from a personal apple ID to and NRCB apple ID, and it presented challenges for her.

Can you tell me if her iPhone set-up was completed? I wasn’t given the new ticket number, so I’m not sure how to track it’s progress. Also, Jason and you both worked on this matter, so he may know as well.

Thank you,

We have had some employees at our head office report that some attachments (that are known to be safe) and websites (such as government websites) are being blocked. I believe this is related to the firewall on our router (Fortinet). I am hoping you can take a look at the firewall settings and check to see if it is being too restrictive.

If you would like more information on attachments/web pages being blocked, Mike was the latest person to report these issues. You can reach Mike at (780) 488-0288, extension 303.

Can you confirm that this laptop didn’t have access to the network?  Do you have any software installed on it that could trace it?

Also, do you have information on the make and model of the laptop (so I can look on Kijiji and such to see if someone is trying to sell it)?

The PowerShell files no longer authenticate as expected, and this has caused us to be locked out of controlling an essential function. Below are the credentials that we are using, minus the password for security reasons. The $computer string has been updated to the new server address, it previously was connecting to ACSA-ERP-001.

Dave,

We would like you on site approx. Wed March 3rd 10:30am / 11am – time to be confirmed for the site walk and prefield of requirements. At that meeting will be other trades required: electrical, designer, furniture, construction, etc. The above time is likely holding.

Please find attached the revised floorplan for Hub Amnor “SP-2 Hub Edmonton Consolidation Feb 26 21”.

For reference I have provided the Original IFT Electrical, as well as the NATG Data Run Designs and the North and South Marked up plans with run numbers – I think these are in your writting.

Please take care of this job for me on site. We will ship you materials as needed.

Your scope of work is:
-Data Cabling
-Data Relocates
-Data Numbering
-Data UNpatching
-Data Repatching
-A good flexible partner: LOL: whatever is required to make things go smooth and work out. I know this is your wheelhouse!!

I don’t need a hard quote as this work is approved. If I ship you materials then a new Service order will accompany that – otherwise, at this time this is the open ticket for everything required.

Some of your time may simply involve “stand by” to ensure everything is working when the employee starts the next morning. If Standby is used please mark that as this is a small data cabling job but needs to go smooth and if you spend 8 hours waiting around then simply state that and charge us. EG Work with Furniture team, wait for Furniture to be assembled Saturday 4 hours.

Questions please call 604-830-1830

Ryan Arnold our Service Coordinator will forward you the service order for this project.

Erica, and team,

Please find attached the IFT Electrical Drawings. I don’t know if those are the finals as IFT is Issued for Tender: they do show a lot of double up desks: I assume power and etc. is primarily there assuming that the furniture and connectors match / fit: I believe the likely decision was simply not to purchase the furniture at the time as it was not required.

I have also attached our diagram which should reflect a majority of our data drops. There was one recent reno to add some more desks a little while ago as well, the general plan should hold. Sorry for the format on t...",1,1,43,Email Connector,2021-02-26 17:15:18

Good day Fidelis

As per your conversation with Joel, he needs a computer set up in his new office space with John Anderson.

We have the computer that was used by Josh in the cage, that is the computer we need set up.

If it makes sense to move Joel's computer to his new space and set up Josh's in Joel's old office that works.

Josh does not use the computer any longer. Joel's old office is now Stephen's office he will be using the computer.

Hi David,

hope that you’re fine.

I added installation packages to the setup folder with a progress bar and interactive version.

These versions should show you a detailed error message, if the upgrade couldn’t be installed.

Last option would be an unmanaged installation, witch we’ll migrate to a managed version afterwards.

Hi David,

during the last weeks we automatically deployed the latest Symantec Endpoint Protection version.

The server systems are looking fine, but as I checked the clients I found notebooks without the firewall component, and it’s advanced features.

On CALHV1 D drive, there are the latest prepared setup files.

Please could you take care of the following notebooks and upgrade them manually!?

I would like to chat with someone about access and better use of our Carya Training Calendar email at Carya.

I would like all staff to have access to this calendar, read access for sure.  I think that is the simple part.  I also want staff to be able to click on a link that will be in the calendar meeting that will then take them to a link to sign up for training.

So for example:

I want staff to be able to see that on April 7 there is a Brain Story Training from 9 – 12.  There is a link in the calendar meeting in Outlook that I want staff to be able to click on to get to the registration site.  I have put a test sample in the Carya Training Calendar for reference.

This email address has been reported as sending auto-responses and as such this email is coming from a DO NOT REPLY address to prevent extra case creation.

In order to follow up on this case, please click here to reply
********************************************************************************

A new case #04217400 has been created for you with Nimble Storage. Information about the case is listed below.

Account Name: Next Digital
Array SN: AF-211983
Array Name: NDDC-N-SAN01
Nimble Group Name: 
Case Number: 04217400
Case Priority: P2
Case Category: Heartbeat
Case Origin: Heartbeat
Case Owner: Support Queue - General

Case Subject: HPE Nimble Storage no longer receiving array heartbeats.
Case Description: PLEASE NOTE: This is an automatically closed case, if condition is expected, no reply is required.
Additional information regarding the issue described below is available to you in the form of an HPE InfoSight Knowledge Base (KB) article.  Articles are hosted from the HPE InfoSight portal. The link provided will allow direct access for only seven (7) days without requiring that you log in to the InfoSight Portal.  Please click on the title link to open or download the article:

No heartbeats from array serial number AF-211983 have been received by HPE Nimble Storage recently. This could indicate a scheduled maintenance, a networking issue or a problem on the array itself. In rare situations the array might no longer be serving data, please make sure to verify the health of the array via GUI or CLI from local network. Heartbeats are an important component of HPE Nimble Storage Remote Support capabilities and it is important that this issue be resolved as soon as possible.
Note: For heartbeat and ASUP delivery, firewalls must be configured to allow the array Management and Support IP's to reach ""nsdiag.nimblestorage.com"" over TCP port 443 (HTTPS).  If the firewall requires a static IP address rather than a hostname and fully qualified domain name, the firewall should be configured to use IP address ""198.54.168.5"".  As of 9AM PST, March 1st, 2017, this IP addresses became the permanent IP Addresses for this server, with no expected additional changes.
If the array is reachable from the local network and there is no impact to production, the communication to the HPE Nimble Storage servers have been impaired. The following situations could apply:

a) HPE Nimble Storage could be performing maintenance which might interfere with this communication. If this is the case, HPE Nimble Storage will post Maintenance Notifications, available upon login to HPE InfoSight at [http://infosight.nimblestorage.com]. During HPE Nimble Storage internal network maintenance, no further actions are needed by HPE Nimble Storage Array storage administrators.

b) If heartbeat or autosupport delivery are being temporarily prevented by local maintenance, or by any other known local condition, please note that the HPE InfoSight portal ( http://infosight.nimblestorage.com/) now supports ""Customer Maintenance Windows"".  Scheduling a ""Maintenance Window"" allows you to suppress case creation for non-critical issues. To set a Maintenance Window, login to the HPE InfoSight portal and navigate to the ""Wellness"" tab and select the ""Manage Maintenance Windows"" button.
To verify proper heartbeat and Autosupport operation, perform the following:
* On the HPE Nimble Storage web GUI, go to the Administration / Autosupport page.
* Click the ""Test Autosupport Settings"" button and verify all tests succeed.
* Click the ""Send Autosupport"" button to send a test Autosupport to HPE Nimb...",1,1,41,Email Connector,2021-02-26 03:50:35

Reactivate the account for Michael Wenig
  
### Details of Issue
Michael Wenig will be working for the NRCB on a contract from March 15 to April 15, 2021. As such, his account and email address (Michael.Wenig@nrcb.ca) will need to be reactivated.
He needs access to the L: Drive (Legal Operations) as well as the CFO database. It is my understanding that Kevin Seward will give him access to the CFO database but I don't know if IT needs to do anything before Kevin gives him access. 
He will need access to the RDS. 
I will set up his Zoom account once his account is activated.

Subject: Splitting Deals

Hey Team,

As you all know we have a 48 hr deadline to get deals split.  We are all pretty good at getting these upstairs within that window but every once in a while it slips.  These late ones cost the dealership a lot of money, hence why the 48 hr deadline in our job description.  Effective Mar 1stwe will implementing a $200 deduction from our gross every day over 48 hrs that a deal is not split.  This does not include Sundays or holidays (however it is best to split before Sunday or the holiday).  I don’t imagine this will affect us at all, however it will provide some accountability.

Please reach out or come see me if you have any questions or concerns with this.

Thanks,

Cory

How to provision wired ports for new licensees
[image]Asem Eldib edited this page
Here's what changed:

...
 Send an E-Mail to Jakov and provide the exact tenant name provided in the ticket and let him know how many ports you will need for this tenant (typically 1 voice and 1 data). It’s also a good idea to provide Jakov with the tenant account number (provided by JLABS) for documentation purposes (which you would have assigned to the tenant when you provision wireless access as per: How to provision wireless access for JLABS licensees ).
 Jakov will make the configuration changes on his end. When done, he will reply back with the switch port numbers you can use for patching.
 ""Schedule a time with the contact at JLABS who submitted the ticket for you to come in.

if you are unable to get onto the site or working remotely, please contact Karen and ask if she can patch the cable

All site visits at JLABS are supervised, and you should bring photo ID with you when visiting the suite. You will be escorted to the server room where you can patch each switch port to its relevant patch panel jack number.

If it’s an emergency, Karen may patch the cable herself in which case you will not have to go in, but always leave this to the client to decide.""

If you hear of any follow-up issues with the licensees not being able to connect their phone or computer to the network, always perform the following quick checks:

Hi,

I have been asked to hook up a monitor for a staff person that is using one of the Surface Pros that I had ordered on Quote AAAQ19961, here is the description:

Microsoft Surface Pro 7 Tablet - 12.3"" - 8 GB RAM - 256 GB SSD - Windows 10 Pro - Platinum - Intel Core i5 10th Gen microSDXC Supported - 2736 x 1824 - PixelSense Display - 5 Megapixel Front Camera

I thought I needed a Mini Display Port Adapter, but the “mini-display port” is different on this model.  I have taken a picture so that you can tell me what I need.  The monitor
Is DVI-D (25 pin).  Below is the Surface Pro connection…?

Thanks,
Joey
