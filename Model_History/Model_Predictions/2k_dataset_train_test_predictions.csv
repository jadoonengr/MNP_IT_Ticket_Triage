"RDS Mime type issues. greetings, one of my staff, mo smith, is hitting a continual issue with her rds and accessing attachments properly. the current issue is accessing pdf files, when she receives pdf attachments to an email she is unable to preview the attachment and when trying to open the file it defaults to ms word; this method does not actually open the file and simply gives her a string of errors and fails to open. in the past i was able to force the mime type to open with adobe reader and it would work for a month or so before redoing it, however, that access has been restricted to administrative privileges. the current process is forcing her to save each file to my documents on rds, right click and select open with and select acrobat reader. this whole process has inherent risks. )can we fix this particular issue for mo (maureen) we setup a strict rds profile setting that will keep each user across all servers operating the same way? this inconsistency happens with default browsers, pdf readers, some servers have ms visio while others do not, number lock and scroll lock seem to be randomly left on a few times each week. i am able to find a work around solution quicker than contacting support on each particular issue, however, light desktop support is not my trade and i cannot provide any long term solution for them. please let me know if there is anything i can do to assist with this process. i am happy to assist with remote access to mos system if needed.",41,1,0,41,1,0,Train
