"ESSLv Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability ((poodle) description sslv padding oracle on downgraded legacy encryption vulnerability (poodle) discovered on: (tcp ) (tcp ) (tcp ) the remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (mitm) information disclosure vulnerability known as poodle. the vulnerability is due to the way ssl handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (cbc) mode. mitm attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created ssl connections. as long as a client and service both support sslvconnection can be 'rolled back' to sslv , even if tlsv or newer is supported by the client and service. the tls fallback scsv mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. sites that cannot disable sslv immediately should enable this mechanism. this is a vulnerability in the sslv specification, not in any particular ssl implementation. disabling sslv is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability. recommended solution: mnp recommends disabling sslv services that must support sslv should enable the tls fallback scsv mechanism until sslv can be disabled. ? no ? some ? work impacting",43,0,0,41,0,1,Train
